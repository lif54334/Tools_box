3、APPLICATION OF COMPRESSED MAGNETIC FIELDS TO THE IGNITION AND  THERMONUCLEAR BURN OF INERTIAL CONFINEMENT FUSION TARGETS
摘要：Application of axial seed magnetic fields in the range 20-100 T that compress to greater than 10, 000 T (100 MG) under typical NIF implosion conditions may significantly relax the conditions required for ignition and propagating burn in NIF ignition targets that are degraded by hydrodynamic instabilities. Such magnetic fields can :  (a) permit the recovery of ignition,  or at least significant alpha particle heating,  in submarginal NIF targets that would otherwise fail because of adverse hydrodynamic instability growth,  (b) permit the attainment of ignition in conventional cryogenic layered solid-DT targets redesigned to operate under reduced drive conditions,  (c) permit the attainment of volumetric ignition in simpler,  room-temperature single-shell DT gas capsules,  and (d) ameliorate adverse hohlraum plasma conditions during laser drive and capsule compression. In general,  an applied magnetic field should always improve the ignition condition for any NIF ignition target design.

51、HIGH POWER TW/PW LASER IRRADIATION
摘要：The present invention refers to the method used to form diamond nano-sized structures on certain substrates made from interest materials for nuclear fusion using lasers in impulses. The present invention uses short laser beams (fs,  ps) produced with a repetition rate of 1- 10 Hz,  and wavelength from around 750 nm until around 850 nm,  the most frequent at a frequency of 800 nm in vacuum or gaseous atmosphere (air or deuterium).The mixed films containing Be,  C,  W were obtained using the thermionic vacuum arc method (TVA). These films have thicknesses of 0.1 - 10 μm and interact directly with single or multiple laser beams as well as with the plasma produced by indirect laser beam irradiation in ambient gases as air or deuterium. The laser pulses produce diamond or fullerene nanostructures on the irradiated mixed materials surface.By this method,  the irradiated material is processed in a non-thermal mechanism. Multiphotonic interactions and collision ionizations combination creates plasmas in the impact areas of shorter term than the kinetic electron energy that can be transferred in the material. The produced plasma is not in thermal equilibrium,  the irradiated material being changed from initial solid state in totally ionized plasma in such a short time that the thermal equilibrium can not be reached. As a result,  a negligible thermal transfer to the layers outside the interaction area occurs. The transition of this non-thermal regime to the thermal regime depends on the irradiated material and it is in the range 1 to 20 ps. Due to the fact that the unexposed area heating is negligible,  the adjacent material composition is substantially unaffected by the irradiation process proposed in the present invention.

53、TW/PW-CLASS POWER LASER IRRADIATION
摘要：The invention relates to a method for producing nanometric layers with content of diamond or fullerene nanoparticles,  by irradiation with ultrashort pulses within the range of picoseconds and femtoseconds,  generated by high power lasers (terawatt - TW or petawatt - PW) and,  in particular,  to a process of forming diamond/fullerene structures on layers of interest for the nuclear fusion,  namely C,  Be and W layers. According to the invention,  the method of modifying a layer deposited on a graphite sublayer consists in producing,  by the thermionic vacuum arc method,  a C and W bi-layer with the W layer thickness ranging between 2000...2500 nm and that of the C layer ranging between 180...200 nm,  deposited on a parallelepipedal graphite sublayer,  guiding some laser beams of short duration 100...300 ps in mono-pulse or multi-pulse,  with peak power within the range 10...10watt,  with pulse energies in the range of micro-Joule to milli-Joule,  by means of a lens,  in a focal point having the size of 20 x 2 mm,  in order to form,  by multi-photon absorption,  diamond nanocrystals embedded in an amorphous C matrix.

77、High power fiber amplifier laser pump signal combiner for high efficiency and application
摘要：A high efficiency optical combiner minimizes core region distortions in the area where fusion splicing between an input tapered fiber bundle (or any other type of “cladding-less” input fiber) and output fiber are joined. The thickness of the output fiber' s glass cladding layer in the splice region is reduced (if not removed altogether) so that a core-to-core splice is formed and any necked-down region where the glass flows to join the core regions (while also joining the outer diameters) is essentially eliminated. The reduction of distortions in the core region of the splice improves the transmission efficiency between an input tapered fiber bundle and output fiber,  reaching a level of about 99%. This high efficiency optical combiner is particularly well-suited for applications where a number of pump sources are combined and applied as an input to a fiber laser or amplifier.

88、Linear converging/diverging fusion reactor and operating method for achieving clean fusion reactions
摘要：A fusion reactor is provided for achieving ultra-high plasma densities required for achieving clean,  neutron-free,  fusion reactions. This is achieved by designating the reactor with a linear geometry containing an internal plasma flow duct that converges to a point along its central longitudinal axis surrounded by a diverging containment solenoid with increasing wall thickness that generates an increasing axial magnetic field. This field compresses the plasma to ultra high densities as it is magnetically pulled toward the fusion ignition point by the solenoid' s magnetic field gradient. Ignition is achieved by a plurality of high power phased-coherent laser beams converging to the ignition point. A secondary solenoid is mounted around the ignition point that magnetically deflects and focuses the ionized reaction products into a directed beam of high energy charged particles which is fed into an MHD generator thereby converting the fusion power of the reactor directly into electric power.

94、METHOD FOR PREPARING LARGE SIZE YB-YAG LASER CRYSTAL THROUGH KYROPOULOS METHOD
摘要：Disclosed is a method for preparing a large size Yb-YAG laser crystal through Kyropoulos method,  and the steps thereof include furnace charging,  material melting,  crystal seeding,  necking down,  shouldering,  equal-diameter growth,  cooling and annealing. During shouldering,  the rotating speed of the crystal is zero,  and in the shouldering and the subsequent stages thereafter,  the crystal does not rotate. The pulling speed is controlled in a range of 0.05-0.3 mm/h,  the weight increase rate is controlled in a range of 10-250 g/h,  and after the crystal diameter grows to a desired diameter,  the shouldering process is completed. During the equal-diameter growth,  the heating power is adjusted to uniformly increase the crystal weight at an increase rate of 250-900 g/h until the weight does not increase any more,  at which time the crystal growth is completed. A Yb-YAG crystal grown by the inventive method has prominent advantages of a large size,  a low defect density,  no core,  a high utilization rate,  a low cost,  etc.,  and can meet the requirements of large size Yb-YAG crystals for large-scale high-power laser devices.

125、APPLICATION OF COMPRESSED MAGNETIC FIELDS TO THE IGNITION AND THERMONUCLEAR BURN OF INERTIAL CONFINEMENT FUSION TARGETS
摘要：Application of axial seed magnetic fields in the range 20-100 T that compress to greater than 10, 000 T (100 MG) under typical NIF implosion conditions may significantly relax the conditions required for ignition and propagating burn in NIF ignition targets that are degraded by hydrodynamic instabilities. Such magnetic fields can :  (a) permit the recovery of ignition,  or at least significant alpha particle heating,  in submarginal NIF targets that would otherwise fail because of adverse hydrodynamic instability growth,  (b) permit the attainment of ignition in conventional cryogenic layered solid-DT targets redesigned to operate under reduced drive conditions,  (c) permit the attainment of volumetric ignition in simpler,  room-temperature single-shell DT gas capsules,  and (d) ameliorate adverse hohlraum plasma conditions during laser drive and capsule compression. In general,  an applied magnetic field should always improve the ignition condition for any NIF ignition target design.

摘要：In the present invention,  there is disclosed a fixed target for nuclear fusion comprising a substrate of solid silicon or gallium nitride,  from which a first layer (110A) enriched with first particles and a second layer (110B) enriched with second particles are made. The enriching first particles are represented particularly by hydrogen particles,  while the enriching second particles are represented particularly by particles of boron or lithium. Apparatus for making nuclear fusion consists of the above-described fixed target (110) arranged in the path of a laser beam emitted by a laser system,  which provides pre-pulses for making a first plasma (P1) in front of the target (110) first layer (110A) and main pulses for making a second plasma (P2),  through the passage of which the main pulse is focused onto the target (110),  where it accelerates at least some of the first particles for making their fusion reaction with at least some of the second particles of the fixed target (110). A method of making nuclear fusion with the above-described apparatus is characterized in that a fixed target (110) is irradiated by a laser pre-pulse from a laser system and this laser pre-pulse creates at least first plasma (P1) in front of the target (110) first layer (110A),  whereupon for the nuclear fusion,  said fixed target (110) is irradiated by a main laser pulse from the laser system,  which concentrates through the passage of at least one first plasma (P1) to the target (110) such that the concentrated main laser pulse accelerates the first particles of the target (110) in order to create fusion reactions of these accelerated first particles with at least some of the target (110) second particles.

151、Laser fusion system and method
摘要：The invention describes a system,  a method and a target for producing nuclear fusion reactions. A laser is used to irradiate a single temporally shaped laser pulse comprising a pre-pulse and a main pulse or at least two consecutive laser pulses onto the target. A first of the plurality of consecutive laser pulses or a prepulse of the single laser pulse is used to generate a first plasma in front of the target. The system is configured such that this first plasma is capable to focus the second laser pulse or main iaser pulse onto the target,  i.e. to reduce the focal spot size compared to the first or pre-pulse. The plasma initiates a so-called selffocusing of the second or main laser pulse onto the target. The focused second or main laser pulse can then be used to accelerate first particles such that these accelerated first particles produce nuclear fusion reactions with second particles contained in the target.

T. SIMPK1N Deputy Managing Director — UK Translation DivisionFor and on behalf of RWS Group Ltd 1METHOD FOR OPTIMALLY DETERMINING THE CHARACTERISTICS AND ARRANGEMENT OF A SET OF SENSORS FOR MONITORING AN AREA5 The subject of the present invention is a method for determining thecharacteristics and arrangement of a set of devices or sensors for monitoring a zone of interest.It applies notably in aiding the design of a system for monitoring azone of interest through a network of fixed sensors and in determining the 10 optimum position and optimum adjustment of these sensors in the zoneunder a set of given constraints.The invention applies to any type of device or sensor in particular a camera,  a radar,  a seismic or acoustic sensor or else a motion detection device.15The technical problem at which the present invention is aimed relates to the automatic allocation of a set of sensors,  operating in a network,  in a manner adapted to the monitoring of a predefined zone of interest. This problem is notably encountered by a monitoring system20 designer or a user of such a system. It consists,  on the basis of a set of sensors each having specific characteristics according to particular technologies,  of a set of absolute constraints to be complied with and of a set of properties that it is desired to optimize,  in determining the combination,  in terms of number and type from among those available,  of25 sensors making it possible to satisfy these absolute constraints and to optimize these properties. A second problem is also aimed at determining the optimum position and optimum adjustment of the sensors determined previously within the monitoring zone so as to optimize performance for constrained resources.30 The network of sensors chosen must comply with one or moreabsolute constraints,  for example,  a maximum budget,  maximum energy reserve,  maximum carriage or minimum detection performance. 2The properties to be optimized are,  for example,  the total price of the system,  a probability of target detection,  an accuracy of location in two or three dimensions. The properties are classed empirically by relative significance.5 The technical problem at which the present invention is aimed is aproblem of constrained multicriterion optimization of a set of heterogeneous cost functions of arbitrary complexity. These functions being able to be of diverse nature,  analytical or non-analytical,  continuous or non-continuous,  differentiable or non-differentiable. Some constraints may be expressed by 10 simple functions. For example,  the total price of the system corresponds to a simple sum of the prices of its constituents. Likewise the total weight of the system is also obtained by the sum of the weights of each sensor. On the other hand,  other constraints are modeled by more complex functions. Thus the probability of detecting a target can depend on an a priori 15 probability density of presence of the target,  the target-sensor distance or indeed the intervisibility. Accuracy of location based on fusion between sensors can involve the probabilities of detection,  the accuracies of elementary measurements and the mutual relative positions of the sensors. 20 The solutions of the prior art which address the problem of theoptimization of sensor networks relate essentially to the deployment of networks of wireless devices and are aimed at optimizing the means of communication. The problem area thus tackled relates in particular to the maintaining of the service and the autonomy of the antennas and not the 25 optimization of the coverage of a monitoring zone as a function of diverse constraints on the sensors.Concerning the problem area of the optimal positioning of monitoring sensors,  patent application US 7395195 proposes a device allowing the representation of a network of devices,  the allocation of calculation 30 resources and the positioning of said sensors. Patent application US 7693049 implements a stochastic optimization technique essentially focused on the conservation of energy resources. 3In addition to the fact that the two aforementioned patent applications are aimed at only part of the wider problem that the present invention proposes to solve,  they also exhibit limitations in relation to the optimization constraints that they can take into account. Generally,  the5 known schemes implement conventional optimization schemes such as the gradient scheme. Such schemes exhibit the following drawbacks. They afford a solution to the global optimization problem only if the optimization constraints are modeled by differentiable functions,  this representing a significant limitation that the present invention is aimed at removing.10 Moreover these schemes do not make it possible to avoid the phenomena of local minima or maxima which represent unsatisfactory solutions. It is also possible to use schemes based on a genetic algorithm,  but these are not applicable to all cost functionals and do not guarantee convergence to a valid solution in all cases.15The present invention makes it possible to remove the limitations of the prior art by proposing a completely automated solution for determining the sensors in terms of number,  type and position.For this purpose,  the subject of the invention is an iterative method, 20 implemented by computer,  of optimized design of a system for monitoring a geographical zone comprising a plurality of sensors of different types and characteristics represented by a vector S each component of which indicates the type and the characteristics of a sensor and its position in said zone,  said system exhibiting a plurality of absolute technical constraints, 25 said method being characterized in that it comprises at least the following steps : o a step of initializing the vector S to a solution So, o a step of perturbing the sensors making up the solution So at the iteration of index n,  to obtain a new candidate solution 5, 1 at the30 iteration of index n+1,  said perturbation entailing changing the type or a characteristic of at least one of said sensors,  the possible sensor types also including a dummy type whose 4characteristics have no impact on the global cost of the solution S, o a step of evaluating the cost of said solution srkm on the basis of a global cost function C(S) determined as a combination of a5 plurality of sub-criteria Ck(S) for optimizing at least one characteristic of said sensors of which the solution S is composed, o a step of selecting the new current solution Sn+1 at the iteration n+1 on the basis of a probability of transition 10 P transition = 77 (C (S n),  C (S n_ Ei )) which decreases as a functionof (C (s?,  ) — C (Sr )) culminating in the selection of the newcandidate solution 5b4-1= 5e+1 or in the retaining of the previous solution S+1 =S, a step of storing,  at each iteration,  the best solution Sbest 15 obtained which satisfies the relation : if C(s1) < C(Sb?, ), Sbes,  =a test step for stopping or continuing the iterations of said method, when the stopping test is positive,  a final step of producing the 20 optimal solution Sbest containing the number,  the type,  the characteristics and the position of the sensors suitable for monitoring said geographical zone.In a variant embodiment of the invention,  the method furthermore 25 comprises a step of displaying the positions of said sensors making up the optimal solution Sbest in the geographical zone on a user interface.In another variant embodiment of the invention,  the initialization step comprises at least the following sub-steps : o random selection of the type of each of said sensors from among 30 the available types,  including the dummy type, o random selection of the position of each of said sensors,  5o verification of compliance,  by the solution So,  with all the absolute constraints.In another variant embodiment of the invention,  said sensors are of passive type and are at least taken from the following set :  a camera,  a5 radar,  a seismic sensor,  an acoustic sensor,  a motion detection device,  a detection device based on electrical contact,  a device for detecting radioelectric sources,  a device for detecting nuclear sources,  a magnetic,  capacitive,  inductive,  chemical or bacteriological detection device.In another variant embodiment of the invention,  said sensors are of 10 active type and are at least taken from the following set :  a radar,  an active acoustic detector,  a LIDAR detector,  a detector based on neutron activation,  an active-barrier-based detector.In another variant embodiment of the invention,  an absolute technicalconstraint is a constraint of maximum weight or maximum price or of 15 minimum accuracy of location over a given geographical zone.In another variant embodiment of the invention,  a characteristic of asensor comprises its weight,  its price,  its probability of detecting a target,  itsdetection radius.In another variant embodiment of the invention,  an optimization sub 20 criterion is the global weight of the set of said sensors or the global price of the set of said sensors or the degree of coverage of the monitored zone or the accuracy of location of a target in the monitored zone,  said sub-criterion being able to be computed numerically for the set of sensors making up the solution S. 25 In another variant embodiment of the invention,  at least one of the sub criteria depends on a significance map which allocates for each mesh cell,  with coordinates i, j,  of the geographical zone to be mo

摘要：本发明属于核能技术领域，具体涉及一种实现轻核聚合的方法。首先，制作直径在纳米量级的金属钯微球，并将其置于D气中，因为金属钯具有极强的吸附D的能力，因此D进入金属钯的晶格内紧密排列，原子核间距远低于正常状态。然后，将饱和吸附D的金属钯微球投入反应堆容器中，以若干束强脉冲激光成对称进行打靶，靶球内的D在高能量激光的作用下克服核力作用，聚合为更高原子序数的原子，并释放出大量的能量。本发明提供的技术方案由于采取金属钯吸附D气，使D原子之间的距离远小于常态，因此可以有效地降低激光打靶所需要的能量，促进轻核聚变的实现。

251、Nuclear fusion power plant having a liquid reactor core of molten glass that is made laseractive and functions as a tritium breeding blanket which is capable of acousticly compressing/confining fuel so that it radiates and triggers outgoing laser cascades that will reflect from the blast chamber' s spherical inside wall and return like photonic Tsunamis,  crushing,  heating,  and causing thermonuclear ignition of the fuel so that heat engines and piezoelectric harvesters can convert the released energy into electricity
摘要：A nuclear fusion power plant having a spherical blast-chamber filled with a liquid coolant that breeds tritium,  absorbs neutrons,  and functions as both an acoustical and laser medium. Fuel bubbles up through the sphere' s base and is positioned using computer guided piezoelectric transducers that are located outside the blast-chamber. These generate phase-shifted standing-waves that tractor the bubble to the center. Once there,  powerful acoustic compression waves are launched. Shortly before these reach the fuel,  an intense burst of light is pumped into the sphere,  making the liquid laser-active. When the shockwaves arrive,  the fuel temperature skyrockets and it radiates brightly. This,  photon-burst,  seeds outgoing laser cascades that return,  greatly amplified,  from the sphere' s polished innards. Trapped within a reflecting sphere,  squeezed on all sides by high-density matter,  the fuel cannot cool or disassemble before thorough combustion. The blast' s kinetic energy is absorbed piezoelectrically.

Once cast,  the working surface of the die or piece is coated with a metal,  an intermetallic or a high performance ceramic. Projection or deposition techniques are used to obtain the high value working surface. Optionally localized fusion treatments (IR,  laser,  HDIR or any other localized energy source) are applied to obtain full density on the surface. Also welding,  laser deposition or any other deposition by melting can be applied (often on top of a deposited or projected intermediate layer). Different layers can be applied,  and trough proper masking a specific surface functionality can be attained. Rolls,  jaws,  bearing supports,  machine benches and other structural parts and any other highly solicited part can be obtained at low cost by means of the present invention.

257、CONTROL OF A LASER INERTIAL CONFINEMENT FUSION-FISSION POWER PLANT
摘要：A laser inertial-confinement fusion-fission energy power plant is described. The fusion-fission hybrid system uses inertial confinement fusion to produce neutrons from a fusion reaction of deuterium and tritium. The fusion neutrons drive a sub-critical blanket of fissile or fertile fuel. A coolant circulated through the fuel extracts heat from the fuel and that heat is used to generate electricity. The inertial confinement fusion reaction can be implemented using central hot spot or fast ignition fusion,  and direct or indirect drive. The fusion neutrons result in ultra-deep burn-up of the fuel in the fission blanket,  thus enabling the burning of nuclear waste. Fuels include depleted uranium,  natural uranium,  enriched uranium,  spent nuclear fuel,  thorium,  and weapons grade plutonium. LIFE engines can meet worldwide electricity needs in a safe and sustainable manner,  while drastically shrinking the highly undesirable stockpiles of depleted uranium,  spent nuclear fuel and excess weapons materials.

265、NEW ENERGIES
摘要：We could use an intense plasma laser to start the reaction and keep it running... 1. First we start with the regular hydrogen atoms colliding creating helium and creating energy 2. Largest magnet ever tried surrounding the plasma. 3. The magnet can be one solid (thick walled) case surrounding the plasma in a vertically standing cylinder design,  or change shape with to suit the roundness of the plasma so the magnet force is even. 4. In the bottom is a magnet floor (cradle possibly for stability having thick enough in its walls to support the magnets above) possibly with a small pool of water and/or source of water via nozzle such that the water clears the plasma,  so it doesn' t touch the plasma (rather it vaporizes because of the heat of the plasma). 5. Surrounding the outside of the magnet layer (the magnet' s outer surface can be coated with a layer of ceramic to counter rust) is a huge boiler which is fed water (possibly salt water to produce disinfected water and fresh water),  at bottlenecks,  the boiler can be huge to absorb the heat from the plasma and also fast moving to keep any one contained area the salt water (possibly other liquids such as ethanol),  from overheating (the expanding heat pressure turns the turbine). 6. There are large (robot controlled) slit/opening (such as sliding visors) at intervals from top to bottom that penetrate through the surrounding magnet that can be open and shut... closed when the plasma is not too cold and/or the salt water is too cold and open to cool off the plasma or heat the boiler more efficiently to expand heat pressure to turn turbine. 7. At the top can be an (oversized) roof platform with ceramic coating and and/or magnet also with open and (robot controlled) shut slits that increase or decrease heat into an exhaust. Above the roof is a boiler pool with exhaust that feed into a turbine. Salt water (and/or other liquid) is fed into the boiler. The roof is needed to be (possibly slide) opened especially when the pool of water below the plasma has vaporized and is causing increased expanded water pressure in the plasma core. 8. An extra layer of boiler can encapsulate the main boiler this extra layer of boiler can be made of ceramic on the outside to add extra layer from overheating the compartment holding the inner plasma chamber. The extra outer layer can also fill its outer chamber with salt water any and all liquids (even ethanol) to expand pressure to spin turbine (eg. and fresh/disinfected water). 9. Alternatively if the boiler is large enough (enough water sandwiched between plasma core (magnets) and the boiler' s walls the inside of the boiler walls can be lined with nanotube solar panels (that can withstand the extreme heat. 10. Additionally the more close contact/exposure material is to the plasma core the more heat resistant the material must be (eg. the magnets) therefore we will attempt to mix the magnet material the closer the more density per volume of magnet material mixed with carbon nano particles-tubes (even mix the molten magnet with diamond dust) used as heat sinks in electric motors to withstand motors'  intense heat. The tiny structures embedded in materials regularly called upon to withstand extreme heat,  such as those that form the exterior panels of airplanes and rockets. In the worse scenario we could mix and make diamond/nano particles-tubes shield in front of the magnets facing the plasma core... Since diamonds are so expensive we might need to play around with the sizes of the plasma core. The carbon nano particles-tubes are added as a cheap cutting cost measure to diamonds. 11. We could also layer a thin layer of either diamonds (container) and a thin layer of carbon nano particles-tubes (with openable slits to vent heat from the plasma core and introduce heat to the outer boilers). The layers of the diamonds and/or carbon nano particles-tubes insulate the magnet(s)... 12. Another material to explore is ceramics mixed with nanotubes The material shows electrical conductivity ten trillion times greater than pure alumina,  and seven times that of previous ceramics made with nanotubes. Thermal properties,  enable conducting heat in one direction,  along the alignment of the nanotubes,  but reflecting heat at right angles to the nanotubes,  making it an attractive material for thermal barrier coatings. This seems the ideal low cost insulator to protect the magnets from overheating while conducting the magnets force back towards the plasma core.13. On top of the roof (above the plasma core) is a boiler where salt water (And/or liquids such as ethanol) is entered at high volume to boil to steam to turn turbines with possible walls made of nanotubes that absorb heat and convert into energy. (GP 0.24%) 14. Any and all components can be composed of ceramics,  titanium,  tungsten steel,  carbon nano materials,  magnets and/or diamonds (GP 0.1 %). 15. We could also use walls of water falling. 16. The walls of water falling unlike filling a choking/smothering the entire container in a tank/boiler (pool of) with water;  can touch and cool off the magnets without smothering out the plasma core. In fact we could adjust the walls of water to vaporize before collecting at the bottom,  so the is no rising level of pool of water on the floor of the boiler that surrounds/holds the magnets which in turn hole the plasma core within. 17. To keep one side from getting hotter than the other sides we could use more water on the overheated face to cool the hotter side... One hydrogen source is from any and all metals (eg aluminium,  zinc... ),  reacting with in a strong acid (eg. muriatic acid),  producing hydrogen gas while crystal remains. The crystal can be used for any and all uses,  from decorative,  ornamental and any and all aesthetic,  parts of walls,  parts of interior furniture and fixtures,  casings of electronics (and anything - objects -that are expensive are the slightest form of status and prestige symbol),  jewelry,  substitute metal and wood,  eg. door knobs,  sculptures,  and decorative car interior/exteriors... The helium output can be used to power cars,  and it has no moving parts. It runs by "thermoacoustics" we simply apply external heat to a cylinder or tank (treat can come from the plasma core production and/or mirrors) with the Helium gas (which is a by- product of the hydrogen atoms colliding) inside the cylinder),  as the gas heats up it generates the acoustic waves making enough heat to make steam and then it is used to generate electricity. For cars the sound is converted into electricity,  via steam. A microphone like devise,  electo-acoustic transducer produces the sound waves. Which can be used to power cars without batteries. therefore no need to discard old batteries which cannot be charged,  whereby electric cars without residual pollution later. And/or use the helium directly as fuel. There considerable growth in demand for helium around the world,  eg. medical,  industrial and electronic use.Re :  Ocean/Seas (1. floors) Energy and/or 2. Hung from Above 1. We make (flatter) bladders that can be made of mix Teflon (for strength) and rubber for bounce back momentum when bent to much and too long,  thus creating more bobbing frequency. The bladder can be filled with enough air to make it stable in water,  neither too stringent floating up and/or less air in the hanging version (even slightly weighted at the bottom of the tip of each bladder unit),  such that the bladders of the hanging version does not float buoyantly,  but rather is the same density/mass as the water so it does not buoyantly float (in one direction and gets stuck there) but rather gets pushed from side to side (on a pivoting ball and socket - swaying) thus either pumping deep salt water (via deep pipe) to a platform and or seashore where the sea water can be used eg. (Gerard Voon' s patented mirrors/boiler/turbine/fresh dienfected water) and/or desalination slat water membranes and/orused to grow (on floating barges) salt water tolerant plants such as mangrove and switch grass (salicornia) for biofuel/biomass... 2. Entire groupings of grids can be installed on the sea/ocean floors with pipes that are pumped powered by the bladders,  with excess enegy stored in our platform and shipping vessel battery power plants above. 3. Alternatively a less buoyant version of the bladders can be hung upside down from floatation objects above,  such as strung between platforms and/or barges and or bobbing grids..,  the difference about our floating bladder bobbers and existing bobber grid technology is that the existing bobber grids partially float out of the water,  making the that old technology vulnerable to high/strong waves,  while our new bladder bobbers are except for solid neck are fully submersed underwater. 4. We could strategically place higher tidal spinning blades secured to posts that clear to the bobbing bladders,  to catch the most wave power out of the ocean. We could also string cables from high posts to high posts (or between platforms) and hang spinning blades at frequent intervals,  underwater. (GP 0.24%)Re :  Floating-Hose Teflon Rubber Ringed 1. The hose is shaped (and/or helixical,  square,  round,  rectangular,  diamond and/or triangular... ) along its length like a shipping vessel such that the bottom is shaped like a hull (without the narrowing in absolute width on both ends. 2. The top is flat and is thicker with a rubber layer to maintain stability (spinning of the hose),  at the mercy of the waves. 3. Along most of the length of the hose are a loose skin of thin Teflon and/or mixed with plastic and/or mixed with zip log material bags along the front end and then stronger material (eg. Teflon to Teflon/rubber mix on the turbine end). 4. Along its length are rings (whose size must balance its stiffness interfering with the wave squeezing the bulge - eg. large enough to allow the bulge to pass without disrupting (if too small,  the rubber ring may bleed the bulge' s force) also disrupting the squeezebility of the wave that is squeezing (bending the hose behind the bulge inwards) to result in being directed away from the hose (the vectors of the wave if the rubber rings are too big,  may end up at or outwards of the perimeter of the rubber ring keeping in mind that the rubber rings may need to be wider than the alternate intervals of loose skin) while rubber rings their size and intervals are needed to provide support so the hose does not collapse inwardly. 5. Along its length in order maintain rigidity to keep the hose flexible with the waves while able to recover its orientation,  (preventing collapsing and/or kinking,  we line every sharp angle on the dissection of the perimeter of the hose all along the lengths with rubber (eg. tube). 6. In the front of the hose is are flaps that open (can dip inwards in a curved gradual design to get water to siphon into the hole while the gaps between sharp corners allow water to pass to surround the the hose exterior length,  thus providing squeezing pressure) outwards,  such that waves inside the flap are directed into the hose opening,  while wave flow outside the flaps directs flow towards the outside of the hose thus squeezing the bulge from outside the hose.(GP 0.25%)Re :  Stirling EngineWe could use helium waste (See pg. 165 Re :  Fusion Reaction) from Fusion Reactors and/or gasoline,  kerosene,  diesel,  vegetable oil,  hydrogen,  even wood-to power Stirling Engine any and all mechanical and any and all things requiring power/energy...On a large scale we could (Re :  Battery Power Plant pg. 128 - for storage of the electricity produced and transport in large battery exchange programs with gas stations/parkades even delivery to homes/offices...any and all uses supplying fully charged batteries for used batteries like water cooler full for empty delivery and pick up,  the delivery can even be like Automobile Association delivery to places where the member has run out of and/or low on low on energy) use helium waste (see pg. 165 Re :  Fusion Reaction) from fusion reactors and/orgasoline,  kerosene,  diesel,  vegetable oil,  hydrogen,  even wood...

276、NEUTRON GENERATOR USING COMPRESSED FUSIBLE MATERIAL AND LASER PULSE
摘要：To generate neutrons,  a nuclei fusible material is placed between opposed anvils of a mechanical pressing device. Force is applied to an anvil face to compress the fusible material to a high pressure. A laser light pulse is then directed through the anvil face and into the compressed fusible material. This laser light pulse is focused by an optical system to a focal spot in the compressed fusible material,  to cause a small portion of the compressed fusible material at the focal spot to be further locally compressed and heated to a temperature whereby a micro plasma is formed in which fusing of nuclei takes place. This fusion reaction of the nuclei in the fusible material thus generates neutrons. In a preferred embodiment,  the mechanical pressing device is a diamond anvil,  and the fusible material is one of deuterium,  tritium,  or a combination thereof.

摘要：One or more beam channels through which laser beams are directed,  via one or more lasers,  onto material of a sample in a sample chamber,  are placed in a sample body. The laser beams generate a plasma in the material of the sample and directly or indirectly trigger reactions in the atomic nucleus or the electron shell. These reactions lead to a nuclear fission or fusion or to the generation of gamma rays or neutrons. Furthermore,  gamma rays or neutrons can be conveyed to the sample body or to the beam channels,  in order to trigger the same reactions. Discs can prevent or delay thermal energy or plasma from escaping in the beam channels. A positive or negative voltage U can be applied to the sample body or to electrodes situated within it,  in order to suck up or convey electrons and favour the desired reactions. The sample body may be wholly or partially transparent,  in order to adjust the focal points of the laser beams onto the material of the sample.

摘要：A laser inertial-confinement fusion-fission energy power plant is described. The fusion-fission hybrid system uses inertial confinement fusion to produce neutrons from a fusion reaction of deuterium and tritium. The fusion neutrons drive a sub-critical blanket of fissile or fertile fuel. A coolant circulated through the fuel extracts heat from the fuel that is used to generate electricity. The inertial confinement fusion reaction can be implemented using central hot spot or fast ignition fusion,  and direct or indirect drive. The fusion neutrons result in ultra-deep burn-up of the fuel in the fission blanket,  thus enabling the burning of nuclear waste. Fuels include depleted uranium,  natural uranium,  enriched uranium,  spent nuclear fuel,  thorium,  and weapons grade plutonium. LIFE engines can meet worldwide electricity needs in a safe and sustainable manner,  while drastically shrinking the highly undesirable stockpiles of depleted uranium,  spent nuclear fuel and excess weapons materials.

摘要：We plan to grow algae,  bamboo,  sugar cane and corn to make ethanol. The sugar cane will be shredded and its liquids squeezed out for ethanol.The remaining fibers will be shredded and cut to an optimal length for agricultural use. Sugar is a form of fertilizer. These fibers will be cooked in manure tea (stirred even blended to instil fertilizing potency - wider blend of nutrients) and rolled and squeezed and cooked in manure tea (stirred even blended to instil fertilizing potency - wider blend of nutrients) rolled and squeezed (depending on whether the results of such a process - high quality organic fertilizer are worthwhile). The fertilizer can even be pelletized.The tea manure as well as the powdered sugar cane can be used to grow algae. The algae could be bagged with transparent bags and solar panels underneath the bags could further make the most use of the site by both producing energy;  Solar panel energy and algae converted into ethanol. A self brewed medium for algae includes Glucose,  Na2HPO4,  KH2PO4,  NH4Cl,  NaCl, MgSO4,  CaCl2...The sugar cane fibers as well as the corn shredded husks can also be used to make soil substrate (GP 0.05%) as well as biodegradable seeding and trans planting and all planting pots,  biodegradable packaging,  bags,  imitation cardboard,  pulp and paper,  envelopes,  books,  treated with preservatives and mixed with adhesive and compressed to produce a form of gypsum;  fiber board,  faux wood cabinetry,  door,  frames,  posts,  exterior finishing,  all construction usage,  including wood floors,  wood ceilings,  roofing,  shutters,  closet doors,  faux wood furniture 2%,  all housing,  all office,  all real estate,  all condominiums,  all sky scrappers,  all apartments,  all wood finishings,  all shelves,  (all decorations 5%),  all wood decks,  all gazebos,  all wood structures,  all sheds,  all extra wood structures (eg. pool house or tree house), The powdered sugar cane fiber and powdered corn husks can be mixed with resin; As well as the 3-dimensional modeling printer,  we could also build plastic/resin (perhaps mixed with particle/gypsum board) or glues/adhesives structures.

319、METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR INERTIAL CONFINEMENT FUSION REACTIONS
摘要：METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR INERTIAL CONFINEMENT FUSION REACTIONS FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0001] The present invention relates to methods and systems for extracting energy from fusion reactions. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0002] It is widely recognized that controlled fusion offers a clean and plentiful energy source. However,  despite billions of dollars invested,  only limited success has been achieved in creating an efficient,  self-sustaining fusion reaction. All prior approaches have been limited by three major factors :  (a) Only a single means of energy extraction is used. (b) Instead of focusing on Direct Drive X-ray driven reactions,  the bulk of the work has been focused on indirect drive reactions,  particularly using large lasers as drivers. (c) Hydrodynamic Instability is a serious problem. This occurs when the compression of the target pellet is not sufficiently uniform. It gives rise to local thermal non-uniformity which,  in turn,  causes local cooling. This results in an unsymmetrical burn of the fuel. [0003] Energy can be extracted from a fusion reaction by two primary means :  Thermal and Electrical. Thermal extraction is a straightforward application of the Rankine Thermal Cycle,  which is used in almost every electrical power plant. In this process,  a coolant is heated,  the heated coolant used to turn a turbine,  and the turbine used to turn a generator. This process has a nominal 55% efficiency. [0004] It is both possible and practical to extract electricity directly from fusion plasma. This has been demonstrated many times,  and is a process with an efficiency of about 85%. The disadvantage of this technique to prior art fusion power systems is that it produces high voltage DC. High voltage DC is difficult to work with and,  more importantly,  not suitable for long distance power transmission and distribution. It cannot be readily or efficiently shifted in voltage as AC power can. 1 [0005] Hydrodynamic Instability is a major problem that the designer of every fusion power system faces. Formally known as Rayleigh-Taylor Instability,  it is a problem that arises from non- uniform compression of the fuel pellet. Non-uniformities in excess of 1% in compression result in the formation of "jets" of energy that surge outward and locally cool the target pellet. The current generation of laser driven fusion systems use multiple beams (as many as 192 in one system) to attempt to provide a sufficiently uniform compression of the fuel pellet. [0006] It would be desirable to provide a system for extracting energy from controlled fusion reactions in which both thermal energy and high voltage DC energy are extracted. [0007] It would be desirable if extracted high voltage DC energy can be used as an energysource to sustain controlled fusion reactions. [0008] It would be further desirable to design a system from extracting energy form controlled fusion reactions,  with a high hydrodynamic stability for achieving highly uniform compression of fuel pellets. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0009] One embodiment of the invention provides a system for extracting energy from controlled fusion reactions. The system includes a central target chamber for receiving fusion target material. A plurality of energy drivers are arranged around the target chamber so as to supply energy to fusion target material in the chamber to initiate a controlled fusion reaction of the material,  releasing energy in the forms of fusion plasma and heat. A plurality of means for extracting energy from the fusion reaction are provided,  and comprise means to extract high voltage DC power from the fusion plasma;  and means to extract thermal energy from the central target chamber. [00010] The foregoing embodiment increases efficiency of a fusion power system by extracting both high voltage DC energy and thermal energy. [00011] Another embodiment of the invention provides a system for extracting energy from controlled fusion reactions wherein the plurality of energy drivers are powered by an energy storage means. The energy storage means receives power from a first power supply and provides start-up and make-up power,  and a second power supply derives energy from high voltage DC power extracted from the fusion plasma. The "start-up power" is the total energy 2 required for initiate the fusion reaction and the "make-up power" is the energy that is added to the energy from the second power supply to maintain operation of the fusion reaction. [00012] The foregoing embodiment achieves high efficiency by using the high voltage DC power extracted from the fusion reaction as a source of power for the energy drivers that drive the fusion reactions. This means that most of the energy required to drive the fusion reaction is derived from the (previous) fusion reaction itself. [00013] A further embodiment of the invention provides a system for extracting energy from controlled fusion reactions in which each of the plurality of energy drivers comprises a unitary apparatus. The unitary apparatus produces both (a) an x-ray pulse for causing the fusion target material to undergo a controlled fusion reaction so as to cause energy release in the forms of fusion plasma and heat,  and (b) RF energy to simultaneously heat the fusion target material. [00014] The foregoing embodiment of the invention has the ability to produce an RF heating pulse simultaneously with the x-ray drive pulse without reducing efficiency. This allows the use of RF heating to increase the efficiency of the fusion power system at little additional cost andwith no energy penalty. [00015] A still further embodiment of the invention provides a fusion power system in which an apodizing structure is associated with each energy driver for reshaping the wavefront of the x-ray pulse to be concave from the perspective of the fusion target material. [00016] The foregoing embodiment of the invention corrects the wavefront errors that give rise to Rayleigh-Taylor Hydrodynamic Instability by means of the mentioned Apodizing Filter. As the target pellet is a sphere,  the Apodizing filter is used to change the shape of the compression wavefront to a highly concave surface whose radius matches the radius of the target. By this means,  the wavefront "wraps around" one face of the target and provides totally uniform compression of the target. [00017] A direct benefit of the use of Apodizing Filters to correct the compression wavefront is that the number of beams used to illuminate the target is reduced. Instead of the 192 beams that the National Ignition Facility Fusion Reactor at Lawrence Livermore lab in California uses,  the current embodiment of the invention may allow the use of as far fewer beams,  such as 6. This directly reduces the cost and size of the reactor,  while increasing its reliability. 3

摘要：PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED :  To form a polycrystalline semiconductor film having a uniform crystal grain size by generating homogeneous nucleuses in a crystallizing process for a semiconductor film.SOLUTION :  A photocatalyst layer 4 is formed as a base layer or a cap layer of the semiconductor film. While the photocatalyst layer 4 is irradiated with excitation light 8 having such a wavelength that it is absorbed by the photocatalyst layer 4,  the semiconductor film 5 is irradiated with a laser beam 1 and the semiconductor film 5 is fused and solidified to be crystallized. In this method,  the wettability of semiconductor melt is improved by the super-hydrophilic operation of the photocatalyst layer 4. Consequently,  crystal nucleuses can be generated almost at the fusion point of the semiconductor film 5 on the interface between the semiconductor film 5 and photocatalyst layer 4 and then the polycrystalline semiconductor film can be formed which has the uniform crystal grain size.COPYRIGHT :  (C)2009, JPO&INPIT

330、Magnitites Pycnonuclear Reactions within Electrochemical,  Radioactive and Electromagnetic Medias
摘要：The electrochemically active elements of the transition series include both the third,  fourth and fifth d block elements,  the lanthanides and the actinides. These transition elements have distinct electrochemistry for driving many chemical reactions,  in particular the absorption of large volumes of hydrogen and the formation of various hydrides. In particular,  Pd,  Th,  Ti,  Ag,  Au and La hydrides exhibit anomalous effects. The chemical reactions for forming,  decomposing and rearranging the bonds of metal hydrides involve large energies. Furthermore these metal hydrides and mixtures are here demonstrated to exhibit greater strange cold nuclear reactions both cold fission and cold fusion. This invention provides magnetic,  x-ray,  laser irradiation,  pressure,  neutron beam,  beta ray,  alpha ray,  gamma ray and catalytic technology for accommodating the special conditions for more controlled and accelerated cold nuclear reactions within the dense plasma (pycno) provided by the lattice of these metal hydrides. Under these conditions,  the cold nuclear reactions are controllably enhanced to rates for practical energy sources but the very nonsynergistic nature of these pycnonuclear phenomena diminishes the possibility of runaway or explosive systems.

摘要：FIELD :  microbiological and immunological methods. ^ SUBSTANCE :  invention is intended for use to study structural and functional arrangement of nucleolus and mechanisms of action of pharmacological preparations on human cells. Mouse hybridoma cell strain,  called A3,  is obtained through fusing mouse splenocytes immunized by coarse fraction of nuclei of human cell line RAMOS with cells of mouse myeloma line P30X63-Ag8.653. Resulting hybridoma secretes monoclonal antibodies against antigen,  called A3 antigen,  localized inhuman cell nucleoli irrespective of their tissue or line origin. In cases of different cell fixation ways. A3 antigen is revealed as incorporated in discrete (typically several tens) foci located exclusively in the zone of nucleoli. Unique property of A3 antigen is its high sensitivity to the action of various protein synthesis inhibitors,  e.g. emetine,  anisomicyne,  cycloheximide,  and puromicyne. During incubation of cells in presence of above-listed substances,  A3 antigen migrates from nucleoli to numerous foci located in nuclear nucleoplasma. This A3 antigen migration precedes apoptotic death of cells. Monoclonal antibodies A3 produced by the strain A3 are recommended to reveal nucleoli and to estimate total level of protein synthesis in human cells by cell biology techniques. Antibodies can be used to reveal possible contamination of human cell cultures with another-species cells as well as to investigate biological activity of known and novel protein synthesis inhibitors,  including pharmacological preparations in human in vitro cells. ^ EFFECT :  expanded microbiological and immunological possibilities. ^ 2 cl,  6 dwg

349、HIGH-DENSITY STORAGE OF EXCITED ONE POSITRONIUM BY USE OF PHOTONI BAND GAP TRAPS
摘要：A device is provided that can capture and store electrically neutral excited species of antimatter or exotic matter (a mixture of antimatter and ordinary matter),  in particular,  excited positronium (Ps*). The antimatter trap comprises a three-dimensional or two-dimensional photonic bandgap (PBG) structure containing at least one cavity therein. The species are stored in the cavity or in an array of cavities. The PBG structure blocks premature annihilation of the excited species by preventing decays to the ground state and by blocking the pickoff process.

364、NUCLEAR FUSION REACTOR AND METHOD
摘要：A nuclear fusion reactor (10) comprising a spherical reaction chamber (20) with a mirrored (30) interior surface (22A) filled with a nuclear fusible and laser active gaseous medium (G) such as deuterium. Using rapid gaseous expansion caused by a timed and focused pulsed laser source (32) and/or timed oscillations from a piezoelectric transducer (42),  a spherical acoustic wave pattern (W) centered within the reaction chamber (20) is created at or near a desired frequency. The acoustic wave pattern (W) produces an intensely focused central region with a centered spherical gaseous wave of enhanced density,  pressure,  and temperature. Adiabatic acoustic compressions over the central region cause ionization and radiation to occur. This radiation and subsequent population inversion within the spherical mirrored (30) chamber (20) activate a radial laser pulse (34A) which focuses on the core of the high density plasma at the center (C) of the reaction chamber (20). This radial laser pulse (34A) acting on the enhanced pressure and density of the central wave produces nuclear ignition of the plasma and fusion. The kinetic and radiant energy from fusion further energizes and drives the acoustic process which allows for a self-sustaining recurring ignition temperature plasma requiring the addition of fuel only.

367、High density storage of excited positronium using photonic bandgap traps
摘要：A device is provided that can capture and store electrically neutral excited species of antimatter or exotic matter (a mixture of antimatter and ordinary matter),  in particular,  excited positronium (Ps*). The antimatter trap comprises a three-dimensional or two-dimensional photonic bandgap (PBG) structure containing at least one cavity therein. The species are stored in the cavity or in an array of cavities. The PBG structure blocks premature annihilation of the excited species by preventing decays to the ground state and by blocking the pickoff process. A Bose-Einstein Condensate form of Ps* can be used to increase the storage density. The long lifetime and high storage density achievable in this device offer utility in several fields,  including medicine,  materials testing,  rocket motors,  high power/high energy density storage,  gamma-ray lasers,  and as an ignition device for initiating nuclear fusion reactions in power plant reactors or hybrid rocket propulsion systems.

369、METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR PROVIDING A THIN FILM WITH A CONTROLLED CRYSTAL ORIENTATION USING PULSED LASER INDUCED MELTING AND NUCLEATION-INITIATED CRYSTALLIZATION
摘要：Method and system for generating a metal thin film with a uniform crystalline orientation and a controlled crystalline microstructure are provided. For example,  a metal layer is irradiated with a pulsed laser to completely melt the film throughout its entire thickness. The metal layer can then resolidify to form grains with a substantially uniform orientation. The resolidified metal layer can be irradiated with a sequential lateral solidification technique to modify the crystalline microstructure (e.g.,  create larger grains,  single-crystal regions,  grain boundary controlled microstructures,  etc.) The metal layer can be irradiated by patterning a beam using a mask which includes a first region capable of attenuating the pulsed laser and a second region allowing complete irradiation of sections of the thin film being impinged by the masked laser beam. An inverse dot-patterned mask can be used,  the microstructure that may have substantially the same as the geometric pattern as that of the dots of the mask.

370、Nuclear fusion reactor and method
摘要：A nuclear fusion reactor comprising a spherical reaction chamber with a mirrored interior surface filled with a nuclear fusible and laser active gaseous medium such as deuterium. Using rapid gaseous expansion caused by a focused pulsed laser source and/or timed oscillations from piezoelectric transducer,  a harmonic spherical acoustic wave pattern centered within the reaction chamber is created. This wave pattern is created near a desired frequency and centered in the sphere. The wave pattern contains a central gaseous ball of high-density,  pressure,  and temperature that causes ionization and radiation to occur. This radiation causes the mirrored chamber to activate a spherical laser effect focused on the high pressure plasma at the center of the reaction chamber. This spherical laser pulse acting on high pressure high-density of the central standing wave produces ignition of the gas and fusion. The tremendous energy from fusion drives the acoustic process which ideally allows for a self sustaining ignition temperature plasma requiring the addition of fuel only.

373、Interstellar transport vehicle engine
摘要：This Patent Application is a 10-year culmination of my efforts to create an interstellar transport vehicle engine,  and have finally arrived at providing a new means of transportation for distances outside our known solar system. This vehicle creates matter on its own providing a foothold in space by ejecting antimatter for propulsion. However,  I have gone farther than that by creating an engine that annihilates the antimatter with another generated matter for the safety of our human environment and to maximize matter-antimatter particle reactions for greater propulsion in space. With the Catalasan Nuclear Fusion Reactor coupled with two Electro-Nucleo Genesoids,  this engine can travel to the far reaches of interstellar space. With all due respect,  please note that this application contains dependent connections to two separate applications called the Catalasan Nuclear Fusion Reactor,  a rotating centrifugal laser nuclear fusion reactor,  and Electro-Nucleo Genesoids,  unlimited energy by matter-antimatter production-separtation. It is highly recommended to review these two patent applications before reading this Patent Application in order to fully understand and grasp the content given here,  for a fair and honest evaluation.

374、Catalasan nuclear fusion reactor a rotating centrifugal-laser nuclear fusion reactor
摘要：Generations of Physicists have attempted to build Thermonuclear Fusion Reactors in hope of harnessing the power of the ubiquities Hydrogen and Hydrogen to Helium Reaction. The failure,  I believe,  involves overcomplicated design structures such as plasma,  needing total electromagnetic confinement! Being an educated physicist myself from the University of California at Riverside and with all due respect to scientists,  as Einstein once said,  “Keep it simple stupid, ” is a guiding phenomenon in all of physics. Thus,  I have chosen my design as a very practical Rotating Centrifugal-Laser Nuclear Fusion Reactor,  a design without plasma and involve using a high-speed centrifugal-laser Hydrogen containment fusion reactor.

Freeman and Company,  New York (1984))；Introduction to Protein Structure(C. Branden和J. Tooze编辑, Garland Publishing,  New York,  N.Y. (1991))；以及Thornton等人, Nature 354 : 105 (1991)中描述了此项技艺认可之多肽二级和三级结构的实例，分别以引用的方式并入本文中。; 经常在药学工业中使用非-肽类似物，作为具有类似那些模板肽之特性的药物。将这些类型的非-肽化合物称为"肽模仿物"或"肽模仿物"。Fauchere,  J. Adv. Drug Res. 15 : 29(1986); Veber和Freidinger TINS 392页(1985)；以及Evans等人J. Med.

Rev. Biochem. 61 : 387(1992)，以引用的方式并入本文中)；例如藉着加入能够形成分子内二硫桥的内部半胱胺酸残基，其使肽环化。; "免疫球蛋白"是四聚的分子。在天然存在的免疫球蛋白中，每个四聚体由两对相同的多肽链所组成，每对具有一个"轻"链(大约25 kDa)和一个"重"链(大约50-70 kDa)。每个链的胺基-终端部份包括大约100至110或更多个胺基酸的可变区，主要负责抗原的认知。每个链的羧基-终端部份限定为恒定区，主要负责效应物功能。人类轻链被分类为κ和λ轻链。重链被分类为μ、Δ、γ、α或ε，并分别定义抗体之同型物为IgM、IgD、IgG、IgA和IgE。在轻和重链之中，藉着大约12或更多个胺基酸的"J"区，连接可变和恒定区，而重链亦包括大约10或更多个胺基酸的"D"区。通常参见Fundamental Immunology第7章(Paul,  W.编辑，第2版Raven Press,  N.Y.(1989))(为了所有的目的，全部以引用的方式并入本文中)。每个轻/重链对的可变区形成抗体结合位置，使得整个免疫球蛋白具有两个结合位置。; 免疫球蛋白链显示相对上较保留之架构区(FR)的相同共同结构，藉着三个高变区连接，亦称为互补性决定区或CDRs。得自每一对两个链的CDRs，与架构区排成一直线，而能够与特定的抗原决定位结合。从N-终端到C-终端，轻和重链两者均包括功能部位FR1、CDR1、FR2、CDR2、FR3、CDR3和FR4。每个功能部位的胺基酸分派，系根据Kabat Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest(National Institutes of Health,  Bethesda,  Md.(1987和1991))，或Chothia &amp; amp;  Lesk J. Mol. Biol. 196 : 901-917(1987); Chothia等人, Nature 342 : 878-883 (1989)的定义。; "抗体"意指完整的免疫球蛋白或其抗原-结合部份，其与完整抗体竞争专一结合作用。可藉着重组DNA技术，或藉着完整抗体的酵素或化学切开作用，产制抗原-结合部份。抗原-结合部份特别包括Fab、Fab' 、F(ab' )2、Fv、dAb和互补性决定区(CDR)片段、单链抗体(scFv)、嵌合型抗体、完全体(diabodies)，以及含有至少一部份免疫球蛋白的多肽，该免疫球蛋白足以赋与该多肽专一的抗原结合。; 当在本文中使用时，称为例如2.12.1、2.13.2、2.14.3、4.9.2、4.17.3和6.1.1的抗体，为衍生自相同名称之融合瘤的抗体。例如抗体2.12.1系衍生自融合瘤2.12.1。; Fab片段是单价片段，由VL、VH、CL和CH I功能部位所组成；F(ab' )2片段为二价的片段，包括两个Fab片段，在绞链区藉着二硫桥连接；Fd片段由VH和CH1功能部位所组成；Fv片段则由抗体单臂的VL和VH功能部位所组成；而dAb片段(Ward等人, Nature 341 : 544-546,  1989)则由VH功能部位所组成。; 单链抗体(scFv)是其中经由能够将其制成单一蛋白质链的合成交联剂，使VL和VH区配对，而形成单价分子的抗体(Bird等人, Science 242 : 423-426,  1988，和Huston等人, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85 :  5879-5883,  1988)。完全体是二价的、双重专一性的抗体，其中在单一多肽链上表现VH和VL功能部位，但使用的交联剂太短，以致於不容许在相同链上的两个功能部位之间发生配对，藉此迫使该功能部位与另一个链的互补功能部位配对，并产生两个抗原结合位置(参见，例如Holliger,  P.等人, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90 : 6444-6448,  1993，和Poljak,  R.J.等人, Structure2 : 1121-1123,  1994)。可将一或多个CDRs共价或非-共价地并入分子内，使其成为免疫黏附素(immunoadhesin)。免疫黏附素可并入CDR(s)，成为较大多肽链的一部份，可将CDR(s)与其他多肽链共价连接，或可非共价地并入CDR(s)。CDRs容许免疫黏附素专一地与感兴趣的特定抗原结合。; 抗体可具有一或多个结合位置。如果有一个以上的结合位置，结合位置可以是彼此相同的，或可以是不同的。例如，天然存在的免疫球蛋白具有两个相同的结合位置，单链抗体或Fab片段具有一个结合位置，而"双重专一的"或"双重功能的"抗体具有两个不同的结合位置。; "经过分离的抗体"是(1)并未与天然存在之组份连接，包括在自然状态下伴随着它的其他天然连接之抗体，(2)不含得自相同物种的其他蛋白质，(3)由得自不同物种的细胞表现，或(4)在自然界中不存在的抗体。经过分离之抗体的实例，包括已经使用IGF-IR(已经分离的抗体)，以亲和力纯化的抗-IGF-IR抗体，已经藉着融合瘤或其他细胞株，在活体外合成的抗-IGF-IR抗体，以及衍生自基因转殖老鼠的人类抗-IGF-IR抗体。; "人类抗体"一词，包括所有具有一或多个衍生自人类免疫球蛋白序列之可变和恒定区的抗体。在较佳的具体实施例中，所有的可变和恒定功能部位均衍生自人类的免疫球蛋白序列(完全的人类抗体)。可藉着各种方法，像是在下文中描述的，来制备这些抗体。; 人类化抗体是衍生自非-人类物种的抗体，其中已经使在重和轻链之架构和恒定功能部位中的某些胺基酸突变，而得以避免或废止在人类中的免疫反应。或者，可藉着将得自人类抗体的恒定功能部位与非-人类物种的可变功能部位融合，来产制人类化的抗体。可在美国专利第6, 054, 297号、5, 886, 152号和5, 877, 293号中，找到如何制造人类化抗体的实例。; "嵌合型抗体"一词意指含有一或多个得自一个抗体的区域，以及一或多个得自一或多个其他抗体的区域的抗体。在较佳的具体实施例中，一或多个CDRs衍生自人类抗-IGF-IR抗体。在一个更佳的具体实施例中，所有的CDRs均衍生自人类抗-IGF-IR抗体。在另一个较佳的具体实施例中，混合得自一个以上的人类抗-IGF-IR抗体之CDRs，并与嵌合型抗体相配。例如，嵌合型抗体可包括得自第一个人类抗-IGF-IR抗体之轻链的CDR1，可使其与得自第二个人类抗-IGF-IR抗体之轻链的CDR2和CDR3混合，而得自重链的CDRs则可衍生自第三个抗-IGF-IR抗体。此外，架构区可衍生自相同的抗-IGF-IR抗体其中之一、一或多个不同的抗体，像是人类抗体，或衍生自人类化的抗体。; "中和抗体"或"抑制性抗体"，为抑制IGF-IR与IGF-I结合的抗体，此时过量的抗-IGF-IR抗体，降低了与IGF-IR结合之IGF-I含量至少大约20%。在较佳的具体实施例中，抗体降低与IGF-IR结合之IGF-I的含量至少40%，更佳的是60%，再更佳的是80%，或再更佳的是85%。可藉着熟谙此艺者已知的任何方法来测量结合作用的降低，例如，以在活体外的竞争性结合测定来测量之。在下文的实例Ⅳ中提供了测量在IGF-I与IGF-IR之结合作用上的降低的实例。; "激活抗体"是在加至表现IGF-IR的细胞、组织或生物中时，激活IGF-IR至少大约20%的抗体。在较佳的具体实施例中，抗体激活IGF-IR活性至少40%，更佳的是60%，再更佳的是80%，或再更佳的是85%。在更佳的具体实施例中，在IGF-I或IGF-II的存在下加入激活抗体。在另一个较佳的具体实施例中，藉着定出IGF-IR之酪胺酸自体磷酸化作用的含量，来测量激活抗体的活性。; 可由熟谙此艺者，依据本说明书的教导，迅速地制备抗体之片段或类似物。片段或类似物的胺基-和羧基终端最好出现在接近有功能之功能部位的分界处。可藉着将核苷酸及/或胺基酸序列数据与公告或专利的序列资料库相比较，确认结构和功能上的功能部位。最好是使用电脑化的比较方法，来确认序列主题，或预测蛋白质构形功能部位，其出现在具有已知结构及/或功能的其他蛋白质中。确认折叠成已知之三维结构的蛋白质序列的方法是已知的。Bowie等人, Science 253 : 164 (1991)。; 当在本文中使用"表面等离子体激光共振"一词时，意指容许藉着检测在生物感应器矩阵内，在蛋白质浓度上的改变，而分析即时生物专一之交互作用的光学现象，例如使用BIAcore系统(Pharmacia Biosensor AB,  Uppsala,  Sweden and Piscataway,  N.J.)。关於进一步的说明，参见Jonsson,  U.等人(1993)Ann.

Acids Res. 14 : 9081(1986); Stec等人J. Am. Chem. Soc. 106 : 6077(1984); Stein等人Nucl. Acids Res. 16 : 3209 (1988); Zon等人Anti-Cancer Drug Design 6 : 539 (1991);  Zon等人Oligonucleotides and Analogues :  A Practical Approach第87-108页(F. Eckstein编辑, Oxford University Press,  Oxford England (1991))；Stec等人美国专利第5, 151, 510号；Uhlmann和Peyman Chemical Reviews 90 : 543 (1990)，将其揭示内容以引用的方式并入本文中。若需要，寡核苷酸可包括检测用的标记。; "以可操作之方式连接的"序列，包括与感兴趣之基因相邻的表现控制序列，和以反向作用，或在远处控制感兴趣之基因的表现控制序列。当在本文中使用"表现控制序列"一词时，意指多核苷酸序列，其为完成表现，以及加工处理与其连接之密码序列所必需的。表现控制序列包括适当的转录开始、终止、启动基因和促进子序列；有效的RNA加工处理信号，像是接合和聚腺苷酸化作用信号；使细胞质mRNA稳定的序列；促进转译效力的序列(也就是Kozak一致序列)；促进蛋白质稳定性的序列；以及在想要时，促进蛋白质分泌的序列。这类控制序列的性质，依据宿主生物而有所不同；在原核生物中，这类控制序列通常包括启动基因、核糖体结合位置和转录终止序列；在真核生物中，这类控制序列通常包括启动基因和转录终止序列。"控制序列"一词企图最少包括其出现对於表现和加工处理而言是必要的所有组份，且亦可包括额外的组份，其存在是有利的，例如前导序列和融合夥伴序列。; 当在本文中使用"载体"一词时，意指能够运送已经与其连接之其他核酸的核酸分子。一种类型的载体为"质体"，意指环状双股的DNA环，可将额外的DNA断片连接到其中。其他类型的载体为病毒载体，其中可将额外的DNA断片连接到病毒基因组内。某些载体能够在导入其之宿主细胞内自动复制(例如，具有细菌复制起点的细菌载体，以及附加体的哺乳动物载体)。其他的载体(例如非-附加体的哺乳动物载体)，当导入宿主细胞内时，可以被整合到宿主细胞的基因组内，并藉此与宿主基因组一起复制。此外，某些载体能够指挥以可操作方式与其连接之基因的表现。在本文中将这类载体称为"重组表现载体"(或简称为"表现载体")。一般而言，用於重组DNA技术中的表现载体，通常是以质体之形式。在本说明书中，"质体"和"载体"可交替使用，因为质体是最常用的载体形式。然而，本发明亦企图包括其他形式的表现载体，像是病毒载体(例如复制缺陷的逆转录病毒、腺病毒和与腺-有关的病毒)，其提供相等的功能。; 当在本文中使用"重组的宿主细胞"(或简称为"宿主细胞")时，企图意指已经在其中导入重组表现载体的细胞。请了解这类名词不仅企图意指特定的个体细胞，还包括这类细胞的子代。因为某些修改可能发生在後续的世代中，归因於突变或环境的影响，所以这类子代事实上可能并非与亲代相同，但在本文中使用时，仍包括在"宿主细胞"一词的范围内。; 在本文中提及的"选择性杂交"一词，意指可检测和专一的结合。根据本发明之多核苷酸、寡核苷酸及其片段，在将与非专一之核酸可检测的结合减至最少可察觉量的杂交和冲洗条件下，选择性地与核酸股杂交。可使用"高严格度"或"高度严格的"条件，达到选择性的杂交条件，如同此项技艺中已知并在本文中讨论的。"高严格度"或"高度严格的"条件是将多核苷酸与其他的多核苷酸一起，可将其中一个多核苷酸固定在诸如膜之类的固体表面上，在6X SSPE或SSC，50%甲醯胺，5X登哈特氏(Denhardt' s)试剂，0.5% SDS，100微克/毫升变性的、弄断的鲑精DNA的杂交缓冲溶液中，在42℃的杂交温度下培养12-16小时，接着在55℃下使用1X SSC，0.5% SDS之冲洗缓冲溶液冲洗两次的方法。亦参见Sambrook等人，在前，第9.50-9.55页。; "序列同一性百分比"一词，在核酸序列的前後文中，意指当为了最大的一致性而排成一直线时，在两个序列中相同的残基。序列同一性比较的长度，可以是在至少大约9个核苷酸的股中，通常是至少大约18个核苷酸，更常见的是至少大约24个核苷酸，代表性的是至少28个核苷酸，更具代表性的是至少大约32个核苷酸，而最好是至少大约36、48或更多个核苷酸。在此项技艺中已知有许多不同的演算法，可用来测量核苷酸序列的同一性。例如，可使用FASTA、Gap或Bestfit比较多核苷酸序列，其为在Wisconsin套装软体10.0版，Genetics Computer Group (GCG),  Madison Wisconsin中的程式。FASTA包括，例如程式FASTA2和FASTA3，提供在问题和搜寻序列之间，最佳部份重叠之区域的排列和序列同一性百分比(Pearson,  Methods Enzymol. 183 : 63-98 (1990);  Pearson,  Methods Mol. Biol. 132 : 185-219 (2000);  Pearson,  Methods Enzymol. 266 : 227-258 (1996);  Pearson,  J. Mol. Biol. 276 : 71-84 (1998)；以引用的方式并入本文中)。除非另行指定，使用特定程式或演算法的预设参数。例如，可使用FASTA及其预设参数(字之尺寸为6，以及计分矩阵的NOPAM因子)，或使用Gap及其预设参数，如同在GCG 6.1版中提供的，以引用的方式并入本文中，定出在核酸序列之间的序列同一性百分比。; 提及核酸序列时，除非另行指定，包括其互补物。因此，提及具有特定序列的核酸分子时，应了解包括其互补股，具有其互补之序列。; 在分子生物的技艺中，研究者交替地使用"序列同一性百分比"、"序列类似性百分比"和"序列同种性百分比"一词。在本申请案中，仅就核酸序列而言，这些名词应具有相同的意义。; 当提及核酸或其片段时，"相当大的类似性"或"相当大的序列类似性"一词表示当将适当的核苷酸插入或删除与其他核酸最适切地排成一直线时，按照上文的讨论，藉着任何已熟知的序列同一性之演算法，像是FASTA、BLAST或Gap测量，在至少大约85%，较佳的是至少大约90%，而更佳的是至少大约95%、96%、97%、98%或99%的核苷酸硷基中，有核苷酸序列的同一性。; 当应用在多肽上时，"相当大的同一性"意指当最适切地排列时，像是藉着程式GAP或BESTFIT，使用预射间隙重，两个肽序列共享至少75%或80%的序列同一性，较佳的是至少90%或95%序列同一性，再更佳的是至少98%或99%序列同一性。不相同的残基位置，最好是差异仅在於保留性胺基酸置换。"保留性胺基酸置换"是其中胺基酸残基，被另一个具有带有类似化学特性(例如电荷或忌水性)之侧链(R基团)的胺基酸残基所取代。一般而言，保留性胺基酸置换实质上将不会改变蛋白质的功能特性。在其中二或多个胺基酸序列由於保留性置换而彼此不同的案例中，可能向上调整序列同一性百分比或类似性的程度，以便修正取代作用的保留性质。进行该调整的方法为熟谙此艺者已熟知的。参见，例如Pearson,  Methods Mol. Biol. 24 : 307-31 (1994)，以引用的方式并入本文中。具有带类似化学性质之侧链的胺基酸组别的实例，包括1)脂肪族侧链：甘胺酸、丙胺酸、缬胺酸、亮胺酸和异亮胺酸；2)脂肪族-羟基侧链：丝胺酸和苏胺酸；3)含有醯胺之侧链：天冬醯胺和谷胺醯胺；4)芳香族侧链：苯丙胺酸、酪胺酸和色胺酸；5)硷性侧链：离胺酸、精胺酸和组胺酸；以及6)含硫之侧链为半胱胺酸和甲硫胺酸。较佳的保留性胺基酸置换组为：缬胺酸-亮胺酸-异亮胺酸；苯丙胺酸-酪胺酸；离胺酸-精胺酸；丙胺酸-缬胺酸；谷胺酸-天冬胺酸和天冬醯胺-谷胺醯胺。; 或者，保留性置换为任何在在Gonnet等人, Science 256 : 1443-45 (1992)中揭示的PAM250对数-可能性矩阵中，具有正值的改变，以引用的方式并入本文中。"适度保留性"置换是任何在PAM250对数-可能性矩阵中具有非负值的改变。; 对多肽而言，序列类似性亦称为序列同一性，通常是使用序列分析软体来测量。蛋白质分析软体使用指派给各种取代、删除和其他修改，包括保留性胺基酸置换的类似性测量，将类似的序列配对。例如，GCG含有诸如"Gap"和"Bestfit"之类的程式，可与预设参数一起使用，定出在密切相关的多肽之间，像是得自生物之不同物种的同种多肽，或是在野外型蛋白质与其突变蛋白之间的序列同种性或序列同一性。参见，例如GCG 6.1版。亦可使用利用预设或建议之参数的FASTA，在GCG 6.1版中的一个程式，来比较多肽序列。FASTA(例如FASTA2和FASTA3)提供在问题和搜寻序列之间，最佳部份重叠之区域的排列和序列同一性百分比(Pearson (1990); Pearson (2000))。当比较本发明之序列与含有得自不同生物之大量序列的资料库时，其他较佳的演算法为电脑程式BLAST，尤其是使用预设参数的blastp或tblastn。参见，例如Altschul等人, J. Mol. Biol. 215 : 403-410 (1990); Altschul等人, Nucleic Acids Res. 25 : 3389-402 (1997)；以引用的方式并入本文中。; 比较同种性之多肽序列的长度，通常将是至少大约16个胺基酸残基，经常是至少大约20个残基，更常见的是至少大约24个残基，代表性的是至少大约28个残基，而更佳的是大约35个残基以上。当搜寻含有得自大量不同生物之序列的资料库时，最好是比较胺基酸序列。;

在本文中使用的"制剂"一词，代表化学化合物，化学化合物的混合物，生物学的大分子，或由生物学材料制成的萃取物。当在本文中使用"药学制剂或药物"一词时，意指当适当地投与患者时，能够引起想要之治疗效果的化学化合物或组合物。其他在本文中使用的化学名词，根据在此项技艺中的习惯用法，例如The McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Chemical Terms(Parker,  S.编辑, McGraw-Hill,  San Francisco (1985)，合并於此以作为参考)。; 当在本文中使用"抗赘生物之制剂"一词时，意指具有在人类中抑制赘生物发育或进行之功能特性的制剂，特别是恶性(癌性的)病变，像是癌、肉瘤、淋巴瘤或白血病。转移的抑制作用通常是抗赘生物之制剂的特性。; 患者一词包括人类和兽医个体。; 人类抗-IGF-IR抗体及其特徵; 人类抗体避免某些与具有老鼠或大鼠可变及/或恒定区之抗体有关的问题。这类老鼠或大鼠衍生之序列的存在，可导致抗体的迅速清除，或可导致患者产生对抗该抗体的免疫反应。因此，在一个具体实施例中，本发明提供人类化的抗-IGF-IR抗体。在较佳的具体实施例中，本发明藉着将人类免疫球蛋白基因导入囓齿类中，使得该囓齿类产制完整的人类抗体，而提供完整的人类抗-IGF-IR抗体。更佳的是完整的人类抗-人类IGF-IR抗体。预期完整的人类抗-IGF-IR抗体将对老鼠或老鼠-衍生之单株抗体(Mabs)固有的免疫原性和过敏反应减至最少，并因此增加了所投与之抗体的效力和安全性。预期使用完整的人类抗体，在慢性和再发性的人类疾病，像是炎症反应和癌症之治疗上，提供了相当大的利益，该疾病可能需要重覆的抗体投药。在另一个具体实施例中，本发明提供不与互补物的结合抗-IGF-IR抗体。;

可使用此项技艺中已知的方法，决定抗-IGF-IR抗体是否与相同的抗原结合。例如，可藉着使用抗-IGF-IR抗体来捕捉已知与抗-IGF-IR抗体结合的抗原，像是IGF-IR，从抗体中洗脱出抗原，然後决定受试抗体是否将与该洗脱出的抗原结合，来决定受试的抗-IGF-IR抗体是否与相同的抗原结合。亦可藉着使抗-IGF-IR抗体与IGF-IR在饱和的条件下结合，然後测量受试抗体与IGF-IR结合的能力，来决定抗体是否与像抗-IGF-IR抗体一样的抗原决定位结合。如果受试抗体能够在与抗-IGF-IR抗体相同的时间内与IGF-IR结合，则此时受试抗体是与抗-IGF-IR抗体不同的抗原决定位结合。然而，如果受试抗体不能在同时与IGF-IR结合，则此时受试抗体是与人类抗-IGF-IR抗体相同的抗原决定位结合。可使用ELISA、RIA或表面等离子体激光共振进行该实验。在较佳的具体实施例中，使用表面等离子体激光共振来进行该实验。在更佳的具体实施例中，使用BIAcore。亦可决定抗-IGF-IR抗体是否与抗-IGF-IR抗体产生交叉-竞争。在较佳的具体实施例中，可藉着使用与用来测量抗-IGF-IR抗体是否能够与其他抗-IGF-IR抗体相同之抗原决定位结合相同的方法，来决定抗-IGF-IR抗体是否与其他抗体交叉-竞争。;

序列识别2、6、10、14、18和22号提供六个抗-IGF-IR κ轻链之可变区的胺基酸序列。序列识别38、40和42号提供从其中衍生这六个抗-IGF-IR κ轻链之三个生殖种系κ轻链的胺基酸序列。图1A-1C显示这六个抗-IGF-IR抗体之轻链可变区的核苷酸序列，与从其中衍生它们的生殖种系序列彼此排成一直线。依据本说明书的教导，熟谙此艺者将能够决定这六个抗-IGF-IR κ轻链和生殖种系κ轻链的编码胺基酸序列，并决定在生殖种系序列与抗体序列之间的差异。; 在较佳的具体实施例中，相对於生殖种系的胺基酸序列，抗-IGF-IR抗体的VL含有相同的胺基酸取代，像是任一或多个抗体2.12.1、2.13.2、2.14.3、3.1.1、4.9.2、4.17.3或6.1.1的VL。例如，抗-IGF-IR抗体的VL可含有一或多个与出现在抗体2.13.2中的那些相同的胺基酸取代，与出现在抗体2.14.3中的相同的其他胺基酸取代，以及与抗体4.9.2相同的其他胺基酸取代。以此方式，可混合并配对抗体结合的不同特徵，以便改变，例如抗体对IGF-IR的亲和力，或其与抗原的解离率。在另一个具体实施例中，可在与在任一或多个抗体2.12.1、2.13.2、2.14.3、3.1.1、4.9.2、4.17.3或6.1.1之VL中找到的那些相同的位置处进行胺基酸取代，但宁可进行保留性胺基酸置换，也不愿使用相同的胺基酸。例如，如果与生殖种系相比较，在抗体2.12.1、2.13.2、2.14.3、3.1.1、4.9.2、4.17.3或6.1.1其中之一上的胺基酸取代是谷胺酸，可保留性地取代天冬胺酸。同样地，如果胺基酸取代为丝胺酸，可保留性地取代苏胺酸。; 在另一个较佳的具体实施例中，轻链包括与2.12.1、2.13.2、2.14.3、3.1.1、4.9.2、4.17.3或6.1.1之VL的胺基酸序列相同的胺基酸序列。在另一个更佳的具体实施例中，轻链包括与2.12.1、2.13.2、2.14.3、3.1.1、4.9.2、4.17.3或6.1.1之轻链的CDR区域相同的胺基酸序列。在另一个较佳的具体实施例中，轻链包括得自至少一个2.12.1、2.13.2、2.14.3、3.1.1、4.9.2、4.17.3或6.1.1之轻链的CDR区域的胺基酸序列。在另一个较佳的具体实施例中，轻链包括得自不同轻链之CDRs的胺基酸序列。在更佳的具体实施例中，该得自不同轻链之CDRs，系获自2.12.1、2.13.2、2.14.3、3.1.1、4.9.2、4.17.3或6.1.1。在另一个较佳的具体实施例中，轻链包括选自序列识别2、6、10、14、18或22号之胺基酸序列。在其他的具体实施例中，轻链包括由选自序列识别1、5、9、13、17或21号之核酸序列，或编码从那裏有1-10个胺基酸插入、删除或取代之胺基酸序列的核酸序列编码的胺基酸序列。该胺基酸取代最好是保留性胺基酸置换。在另一个具体实施例中，抗体或其部份包括λ轻链。; 本发明亦提供抗-IGF-IR抗体或其部份，其包括人类重链或衍生自人类重链的序列。在一个具体实施例中，重链胺基酸序列系衍生自人类VHDP-35、DP-47、DP-70、DP-71或VIV-4/4.35基因家族。在较佳的具体实施例中，重链胺基酸序列系衍生自人类VHDP-47基因家族。在更佳的具体实施例中，重链包括与生殖种系VHDP-35、DP-47、DP-70、DP-71或VIV-4/4.35有不超过8个的胺基酸改变，较佳的是不超过6个的胺基酸改变，而更佳的是不超过3个的胺基酸改变。; 序列识别4、8、12、16、20和24号提供六个抗-IGF-IR重链之可变区的胺基酸序列。序列识别30、32、34、36和44号分别提供生殖种系重链DP-35、DP-47、DP-70、DP-71或VIV-4之胺基酸序列，而序列识别29、31、33、35和43号则分别提供其核苷酸序列。图2A-2D显示这六个抗-IGF-IR抗体之可变区的核苷酸序列，与其相对应之生殖种系序列彼此排成一直线。依据本说明书的教导，熟谙此艺者将能够决定这六个抗-IGF-IR重链和生殖种系重链的编码胺基酸序列，并决定在生殖种系序列与抗体序列之间的差异。; 在较佳的具体实施例中，相对於生殖种系的胺基酸序列，抗-IGF-IR抗体的VH含有相同的胺基酸取代，像是任一或多个抗体2.12.1、2.13.2、2.14.3、3.1.1、4.9.2、4.17.3或6.1.1的VH。与上文讨论的类似，抗-IGF-IR抗体的VH可含有一或多个与出现在抗体2.13.2中的那些相同的胺基酸取代，与出现在抗体2.14.3中的相同的其他胺基酸取代，以及与抗体4.9.2相同的其他胺基酸取代。以此方式，可混合并配对抗体结合的不同特徵，以便改变，例如抗体对IGF-IR的亲和力，或其与抗原的解离率。在另一个具体实施例中，可在与在任一或多个抗体2.12.1、2.13.2、2.14.3、3.1.1、4.17.3、4.9.2或6.1.1之VH中找到的那些相同的位置处进行胺基酸取代，但宁可进行保留性胺基酸置换，也不愿使用相同的胺基酸。; 在另一个较佳的具体实施例中，重链包括与2.12.1、2.13.2、2.14.3、3.1.1、4.9.2、4.17.3或6.1.1之VH的胺基酸序列相同的胺基酸序列。在另一个更佳的具体实施例中，重链包括与2.12.1、2.13.2、2.14.3、3.1.1、4.9.2、4.17.3或6.1.1之重链的CDR区域相同的胺基酸序列。在另一个较佳的具体实施例中，重链包括得自至少一个2.12.1、2.13.2、2.14.3、3.1.1、4.9.2、4.17.3或6.1.1之重链的CDR区域的胺基酸序列。在另一个较佳的具体实施例中，重链包括得自不同重链之CDRs的胺基酸序列。在更佳的具体实施例中，该得自不同重链之CDRs，系获自2.12.1、2.13.2、2.14.3、3.1.1、4.9.2、4.17.3或6.1.1。在另一个较佳的具体实施例中，重链包括选自序列识别4、8、12、16、20或24号之胺基酸序列。在其他的具体实施例中，重链包括由选自序列识别3、7、11、15、19或23号之核酸序列，或编码从那裏有1-10个胺基酸插入、删除或取代之胺基酸序列的核酸序列编码的胺基酸序列。在其他的具体实施例中，该胺基酸取代最好是保留性胺基酸置换。; 藉着抗-IGF-IR抗体抑制IGF-IR; IGF-I与IGF-IR结合的抑制作用; 在其他的具体实施例中，本发明提供抗-IGF-IR抗体，其抑制IGF-I与IGF-IR的结合作用，或抑制IGF-II与IGF-IR的结合作用。在较佳的具体实施例中，抗-IGF-IR抗体是人类抗体。在另一个具体实施例中，抗体或其部份以不超过100 nM的IC50抑制在IGF-IR与IGF-I之间的结合作用。在较佳的具体实施例中，IC50不超过10 nM。在更佳的具体实施例中，IC50不超过5 nM。可藉着此项技艺中已知的任何方法来测量IC50。通常，可藉着ELISA或RIA测量IC50。在较佳的具体实施例中，藉着RIA来测量IC50。; 在其他的具体实施例中，本发明提供抗-IGF-IR抗体，其在IGF-I的存在下，防止IGF-IR的激活。在较佳的具体实施例中，抗-IGF-IR抗体抑制了IGF-IR-诱导之酪胺酸磷酸化作用，其在受体被占据时发生。在另一个较佳的具体实施例中，抗-IGF-IR抗体抑制了下游细胞事件的发生。例如，抗-IGF-IR可抑制Shc和胰岛素受体受质(IRS)1和2的酪胺酸磷酸化作用，当以IGF-I处理细胞时，其全部正常被磷酸化(Kim等人, J. Biol. Chem. 273 : 34543-34550,  1998)。藉着经由西方墨点法或免疫沉淀法，定出IGF-IR、Shc、IRS-1或IRS-2之自体磷酸化作用的程度，来决定抗-IGF-IR抗体是否能在IGF-I的存在下，防止IGF-IR的激活作用。在较佳的具体实施例中，将藉着西方墨点法定出IGF-IR之自体磷酸化作用的程度。参见，例如实例VII。; 在本发明的另一项观点中，引起IGF-IR向下调节的抗体系得自以抗体处理的细胞。在一个具体实施例中，将IGF-IR内化到细胞的细胞质内。在抗-IGF-IR抗体与IGF-IR结合之後，内化该抗体，如同由共焦显微镜所示的。不希望与任何理论结合，咸相信将抗体-IGF-IR复合物内化到溶酶体内，并降解之。可藉着此项技艺中已知的方法，包括免疫沉淀法、共焦显微镜或西方墨点法，来测量IGF-IR的向下调节。参见，例如实例Ⅶ。在较佳的具体实施例中，抗体系选自2.12.1、2.13.2、2.14.3、3.1.1、4.9.2或6.1.1，或包括其重链、轻链或抗原-结合区。; 藉着抗-IGF-IR抗体激活IGF-IR; 本发明的其他观点系关於激活抗-IGF-IR抗体。激活抗体与抑制抗体不同，因为它扩大或取代IGF-I对IGF-IR的影响。在一个具体实施例中，激活抗体能够与IGF-IR结合，并在缺乏IGF-I之下使其激活。这类型的激活抗体基本上是IGF-I的模仿物。在另一个具体实施例中，激活抗体扩大IGF-I对IGF-IR的影响。这类型的抗体本身并不能激活IGF-IR，但却在IGF-I的存在下增加IGF-IR的激活作用。可藉着在活体外，在低量IGF-I的存在或缺乏下，以该抗体处理细胞，轻易地区别模仿的抗-IGF-IR抗体和扩大的抗IGF-IR抗体。如果该抗体能够在缺乏IGF-I之下引起IGF-IR的激活作用，例如其增加IGF-IR酪胺酸磷酸化作用，此时该抗体为模仿的抗体。如果抗体在缺乏IGF-I之下，不能引起IGF-IR激活作用，但能扩大IGF-IR激活作用的量，则此时该抗体为扩大的抗体。在较佳的具体实施例中，该激活抗体为4.17.3。在另一个较佳的具体实施例中，该抗体包括得自4.17.3的一或多个CDRs。在另一个较佳的具体实施例中，该抗体系衍生自生殖种系序列O12(轻链)及/或 D71(重链)的任一个或两者。; 藉着抗-IGF-IR抗体，在活体内抑制IGF-IR酪胺酸磷酸化作用、IGF-IR含量和肿瘤细胞生长; 本发明的另一个具体实施例提供抗IGF-IR抗体，其在活体内抑制IGF-IR酪胺酸磷酸化作用和受体含量。在一个具体实施例中，对动物投与抗-IGF-IR抗体，在表现IGF-IR的肿瘤中，引起IGF-IR磷酸酪胺酸信号的降低。在较佳的具体实施例中，抗-IGF-IR抗体引起磷酸酪胺酸信号降低至少20%。在更佳的具体实施例中，抗-IGF-IR抗体引起磷酸酪胺酸信号减少至少60%，更佳的是50%。在再更佳的具体实施例中，抗体在磷酸酪胺酸信号上引起的减少为至少40%，较佳的是30%，更佳的是20%。在较佳的具体实施例中，在测量酪胺酸磷酸化作用的程度之前大约24小时投与抗体。可藉着此项技艺中已知的任何方法来测量酪胺酸磷酸化作用的程度，像是在後文中描述的那些。参见，例如实例Ⅲ和图5。在较佳的具体实施例中，抗体选自2.12.1、2.13.2、2.14.3、3.1.1、4.9.2或6.1.1，或包括其重链、轻链或抗原-结合部份。; 在其他的具体实施例中，对动物投与抗-IGF-IR抗体，在表现IGF-IR的肿瘤中，引起IGF-IR含量的降低。在较佳的具体实施例中，与未处理的动物相比较，抗-IGF-IR抗体引起受体含量降低至少20%。在更佳的具体实施例中，抗-IGF-IR抗体引起受体含量减少至少60%，更佳的是在未处理动物中之受体含量的50%。在再更佳的具体实施例中，抗体引起受体含量降低至少40%，更佳的是30%。在较佳的具体实施例中，在测量IGF-IR含量之前大约24小时投与抗体。可藉着此项技艺中已知的任何方法测量IGF-IR含量，像是在後文中描述的那些。参见，例如实例Ⅷ和图6。在较佳的具体实施例中，抗体选自2.12.1、2.13.2、2.14.3、3.1.1、4.9.2或6.1.1，或包括其重链、轻链或抗原-结合部份。; 在其他的具体实施例中，抗-IGF-IR抗体在活体内抑制肿瘤细胞的生长。肿瘤细胞可衍生自任何的细胞类型，包括但不限於表皮、上皮、内皮、白血病、肉瘤、多发性骨髓瘤或中胚层细胞。肿瘤细胞的实例包括A549(非-小细胞肺癌)细胞、MCF-7细胞、Colo 205细胞、3T3/IGF-IR细胞和A431细胞。在较佳的具体实施例中，与在未处理动物中的肿瘤生长相比较，抗体抑制了肿瘤细胞的生长。在更佳的具体实施例中，抗体抑制肿瘤细胞生长达50%。在再更佳的具体实施例中，抗体抑制肿瘤细胞生长达60%、65%、70%或75%。在一个具体实施例中，在以抗体开始处理动物之後至少7天，再测量肿瘤细胞生长的抑制作用。在更佳的具体实施例中，在以抗体开始处理动物之後至少14天，再测量肿瘤细胞生长的抑制作用。在另一个较佳的具体实施例中，与抗-IGF-IR抗体一起将其他的抗赘生物制剂投与动物。在较佳的具体实施例中，该抗赘生物制剂能够进一步抑制肿瘤细胞的生长。在更佳的具体实施例中，该抗赘生物制剂为亚德里亚霉素、紫杉醇、他莫昔芬、5-氟脱氧尿嘧啶(5-FU)或CP-358, 774。在较佳的具体实施例中，抗赘生物制剂与抗-IGF-IR抗体的共同-投药，在22-24天的期间之後，抑制肿瘤细胞生长至少50%，更佳的是60%、65%、70%或75%，更佳的是80%、85%或90%。参见，例如图7和实例Ⅸ。在较佳的具体实施例中，抗体选自2.12.1、2.13.2、2.14.3、3.1.1、4.9.2或6.1.1，或包括其重链、轻链或抗原-结合部份。; 藉着抗-IGF-IR抗体诱导细胞凋零; 本发明的其他观点提供诱导细胞死亡的抗-IGF-IR抗体。在一个具体实施例中，抗体引起细胞凋零。抗体可在活体内或在活体外引起细胞凋零。一般而言，肿瘤细胞对细胞凋零比正常细胞更敏感，使得抗-IGF-IR抗体的投药优先於正常细胞，引起肿瘤细胞的细胞凋零。在另一个具体实施例中，抗-IGF-IR抗体的投药降低了酵素akt的含量，其涉及磷脂醯肌醇(PI)激酶的路径。该PI路径转而再涉及细胞增殖，并阻止细胞凋零。因此，抑制akt可能引起细胞凋零。在更佳的具体实施例中，在活体内投与抗体引起表现IGF-IR之细胞的细胞凋零。在较佳的具体实施例中，抗体选自2.12.1、2.13.2、2.14.3、3.1.1、4.9.2、或6.1.1，或包括其重链、轻链或抗原结合-部份。; 产制抗体和产生-抗体之细胞株的方法; 免疫作用; 在本发明的一个具体实施例中，藉着以IGF-IR抗原免疫包括一些或全部人类免疫球蛋白位点之非人类动物，来产制人类抗体。在较佳的具体实施例中，非-人类动物是XENOMOUSE TM ，牠是经过设计的老鼠品系，包括大片段的人类免疫球蛋白位点，并在老鼠抗体产制上是有缺陷的。参见，例如Green等人, Nature Genetics 7 : 13-21 (1994)，和美国专利第5, 916, 771号、5, 939, 598号、5, 985, 615号、5, 998, 209号、6, 075, 181号、6, 091, 001号、6, 114, 598号和6, 130, 364号。亦参见1991年7月25日公告的WO 91/10741，1994年2月3日公告的WO 94/02602，1996年10月31日公告的WO 96/34096和WO 96/33735，1998年4月23日公告的WO 98/16654，1998年6月11日公告的WO 98/24893，1998年11月12日公告的WO 98/50433，1999年9月10日公告的WO 99/45031，1999年10月21日公告的WO 99/53049，2000年2月24日公告的WO 00/09560和2000年6月29日公告的WO 00/037504。XENOMOUSE TM 产生完整人类抗体的类成人节目，并产生抗原-专一的人类Mabs。经由导入人类重链位点和κ轻链位点的百万硷基(megabase)大小、生殖种系组态之YAC片段，第二代的XENOMOUSE TM 含有大约80%的人类抗体节目。参见Mendez等人Nature Genetics 15 : 146-156 (1997)，Green和Jakobovits J. Exp. Med. 188 : 483-495 (1998)，将其揭示内容以引用的方式并入本文中。; 本发明亦提供从非-人类、非-老鼠动物中，藉着免疫包括人类免疫球蛋白位点的非-人类基因转殖动物，来制造抗-IGF-IR抗体的方法。可使用刚才描述的方法，来产制这类动物。可按照在美国专利第5, 994, 619号中的描述，修改在这些专利中揭示的方法。在较佳的具体实施例中，非-人类动物可能是大鼠、绵羊、猪、山羊、牛或马。; 在其他的具体实施例中，包括人类免疫球蛋白基因位点的非-人类动物是具有人类免疫球蛋白之"迷你位点(minilocus)"的动物。以迷你位点的方式，可经由纳入得自Ig位点之个别基因，模仿外源的Ig位点。因此，在插入动物内的构筑体中，形成一或多个VH基因、一或多个DH基因、一或多个JH基因、mu恒定区和第二个恒定区(最好是γ恒定区)。特别在美国专利第5, 545, 807号、5, 545, 806号、5, 625, 825号、5, 625, 126号、5, 633, 425号、5, 661, 016号、5, 770, 429号、5, 789, 650号、5, 814, 318号、5, 591, 669号、5, 612, 205号、5, 721, 367号、5, 789, 215号和5, 643, 763号中描述了该方法，以引用的方式并入本文中。; 迷你位点法的优点是迅速，用该方法可产制包括Ig位点之部份的构筑体，并将其导入动物内。然而，迷你位点法潜在的缺点是可能没有充份的免疫球蛋白歧异性，支持完整的B-细胞发育，使得可能有较低的抗体产制。; 为了产制人类抗-IGF-IR抗体，以IGF-IR抗原免疫包括一些或全部人类免疫球蛋白位点的非-人类动物，并从该动物中分离抗体或产制抗体的细胞。IGF-IR抗原可以是经过分离及/或纯化的IGF-IR，且最好是人类的IGF-IR。在另一个具体实施例中，IGF-IR抗原是IGF-IR的片段，最好是IGF-IR的细胞外功能部位。在另一个具体实施例中，IGF- IR抗原是包括至少一个IGF-IR之抗原决定位的片段。在另一个具体实施例中，IGF-IR抗原是在其细胞表面表现IGF-IR的细胞，最好是在其细胞表面过度表现IGF-IR的细胞。; 可藉着此项技艺中已知的任何方法，来进行动物的免疫作用。参见，例如Harlow和Lane,  Antibodies :  A Laboratory Manual,  New York :  Cold Spring Harbor Press,  1990。免疫非-人类动物，像是老鼠、大鼠、绵羊、山羊、猪、牛和马的方法，为此项技艺中已熟知的。参见，例如Harlow和Lane，以及美国专利第5, 994, 619号。在较佳的具体实施例中，将IGF-IR抗体与佐剂一起投与，以便刺激免疫反应。这类佐剂包括完全和不完全的福瑞德氏(Freund' s)佐剂、RIBI(胞壁醯基二肽)或ISCOM(免疫刺激复合物)。这类佐剂可藉着在局部存放处与其螯合，而保护多肽免於迅速地消散，或其可含有刺激宿主对巨噬细胞和免疫系统之其他组份分泌驱化性因子的物质。如果投与多肽，免疫程序最好将涉及延续数周的二或多次之多肽投药。; 实例I提供以在磷酸-缓冲之生理盐水中的全长人类IGF-IR，免疫XENOMOUSE TM 的草案。; 抗体和产制抗体之细胞株的产制; 在以IGF-IR抗原免疫动物之後，可从该动物获得抗体及/或产制-抗体的细胞。藉着采血或牺牲动物，从动物中获得含有抗-IGF-IR抗体的血清。可使用该血清，因为它获自该动物，故可从血清中获得免疫球蛋白片断，或可从血清中纯化出抗-IGF-IR抗体。以此方式获得的血清或免疫球蛋白是多株的，这是不利的，因为限制了可获得之抗体的含量，且多株抗体具有异质阵列的性质。; 在其他的具体实施例中，可从经过免疫的动物来制备产制抗体的永存不死融合瘤。在免疫作用之後，牺牲动物，并将B细胞与永存不死的骨髓瘤细胞融合，如同此项技艺中已熟知的。参见，例如Harlow和Lane，在前。在较佳的具体实施例中，骨髓瘤细胞不分泌免疫球蛋白多肽(非-分泌性细胞株)。在融合并以抗生素选择之後，使用IGF-IR、其部份，或表现IGF-IR的细胞来筛选融合瘤。在较佳的具体实施例中，使用酵素-连结免疫吸附测定(ELISA)或放射性免疫测定(RIA)来进行最初的筛选，最好是ELISA。在WO 00/37504中提供了ELISA筛选的实例，以引用的方式并入本文中。; 在其他的具体实施例中，可从罹患自体免疫障碍和表现抗-IGF-IR抗体的人，来制备产制-抗体的细胞。可藉着分离白血球，并使其接受萤光-激活之细胞分类(FACS)，或以涂覆有IGF-IR或其部份的培养盘挑捡，来分离表现抗-IGF-IR抗体的细胞。可将这些细胞与人类非-分泌性骨髓瘤细胞融合，产制表现人类抗-IGF-IR抗体的人类融合瘤。一般而言，这是较差的具体实施例，因为该抗-IGF-IR抗体可能对IGF-IR具有不良的亲和力。; 选择、选殖，并就想要的特徵，包括强壮的融合瘤生长、高抗体产生和想要的抗体特徵，进一步筛选产制抗-IGF-IR抗体的融合瘤，如同在下文中进一步讨论的。可在活体内，在同基因的动物中，在诸如裸鼠之类缺乏免疫系统的动物中，或在活体外以细胞培养来培养并扩展融合瘤。选择、选殖和扩展融合瘤的方法为熟谙此艺者已熟知的。; 免疫的动物最好是表现人类免疫球蛋白基因的非-人类动物，并将脾脏的B细胞与衍生自与该非-人类动物相同之物种的骨髓瘤融合。更佳的是，免疫的动物是XENOMOUSE TM ，且骨髓瘤细胞株是非-分泌性老鼠骨髓瘤，像是NSO-bcl2之骨髓瘤细胞株。参见，例如实例I。;

Reviews in Immunol. 12125-168 (1992)。可藉着重组DNA技术设计感兴趣的抗体，以相对应的人类序列取代CH1、CH2、CH3、绞链功能部位及/或架构功能部位(参见WO 92/02190和美国专利第5, 530, 101号、5, 585, 089号、5, 693, 761号、5, 693, 792号、5, 714, 350号和5, 777, 085号)。在较佳的具体实施例中，可藉着以相对应的人类序列取代CH1、CH2、CH3、绞链功能部位及/或架构功能部位，同时维持所有的重链、轻链或重和轻链两者的CDRs，将抗-IGF-IR抗体人类化。; 突变抗体; 在其他的具体实施例中，可使用核酸分子、载体和宿主细胞，制造突变的抗-IGF-IR抗体。抗体可以在重及/或轻链的可变功能部位发生突变，改变该抗体的结合特性。例如，可在一或多个CDR区进行突变，以便增加或减少该抗体对IGF-IR的Kd、增加或减少Koff，或改变该抗体的结合专一性。指定-位置之突变生成作用的技术，是此项技艺中已熟知的。参见，例如Sambrook等人和Ausubel等人，在前。在较佳的具体实施例中，在与生殖种系相比较，已知在抗-IGF-IR抗体之可变区已经改变的胺基酸残基处进行突变。在更佳的具体实施例中，在与生殖种系相比较，已知在抗-IGF-IR抗体2.12.1、2.13.2、2.14.3、3.1.1、4.9.2、4.17.3或6.1.1之一的可变区或CDR区域已经改变的胺基酸残基处进行一或多个突变。在另一个具体实施例中，在与生殖种系相比较，已知在其胺基酸序列出现在序列识别2、4、6、8、10、12、14、16、18、20、22或24号中，或其核酸序列出现在序列识别1、3、5、7、9、11、13、15、17、19、21或23号的可变区或CDR区域已经改变的胺基酸残基处进行一或多个突变。在另一个具体实施例中，使核酸分子在一或多个架构区中发生突变。可在架构区或在恒定功能部位进行突变，以便增加抗-IGF-IR抗体的半衰期。参见，例如2000年2月24日公告的WO 00/09560，以引用的方式并入本文中。在一个具体实施例中，可能有一、三或五个点突变，且不超过10个点突变。亦可在架构区或恒定功能部位进行突变，以便改变抗体的免疫原性，提供与其他分子共价或非-共价结合的位置，或改变诸如补体结合之类的特性。在单一突变的抗体中，可分别在架构区、恒定功能部位和可变区进行突变。或者，在单一突变的抗体中，可仅在架构区、可变区或恒定功能部位之一中进行突变。; 在一个具体实施例中，与在突变之前的抗-IGF-IR抗体相比较，在突变的抗-IGF-IR抗体之VH或VL区中，有不超过10个的胺基酸改变。在更佳的具体实施例中，在突变的抗-IGF-IR抗体之VH或VL区中，有不超过5个的胺基酸改变，更佳的是不超过3个的胺基酸改变。在另一个具体实施例中，在恒定功能部位中有不超过15个的胺基酸改变，较佳的是不超过10个的胺基酸改变，更佳的是不超过5个的胺基酸改变。; 经过修改的抗体; 在其他的具体实施例中，可制造融合抗体或免疫黏附素，其包括与其他多肽连接的全部或部份的抗-IGF-IR抗体。在较佳的具体实施例中，仅有抗-IGF-IR抗体的可变区与多肽连接。在另一个较佳的具体实施例中，抗-IGF-IR抗体的VH功能部位与第一个多肽连接，而抗-IGF-IR抗体的VL功能部位与第二个多肽连接，其以其中VH和VL功能部位可彼此产生交互作用，形成抗体结合位置的方式，与第一个多肽连结。在另一个较佳的具体实施例中，藉着交联剂将VH功能部位与VL功能部位分开，使VH和VL功能部位得以与另一个产生交互作用(参见下文的单链抗体)。然後将VH-交联剂-VL抗体与感兴趣的多肽连接。可使用该融合抗体，指挥多肽至表现IGF-IR的细胞或组织。多肽可以是治疗剂，像是毒素、生长因子或其他的调节蛋白质，或可以是诊断制剂，像是可轻易显色的酵素，像是辣根过氧化酶。此外，可创造其中二(或多个)单链抗体彼此连接的融合抗体。如果想要在单一多肽链上创造二价或多价的抗体时，或如果想要创造双重专一性抗体时，这将是有用的。; 欲创造单链抗体(scFv)，将编码VH-和VL-的DNA片段以可操作之方式与编码有弹性之交联剂，例如编码胺基酸序列(Gly4-Ser)3(序列识别60号)的其他片段连接，而得以以连续的单链蛋白质之形式表现VH和VL序列，其中藉着有弹性的交联剂连接VL和VH区(参见，例如Bird等人(1988)Science 242 : 423-426; Huston等人(1988)Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85 : 5879-5883; McCafferty等人Nature (1990)348 : 552-554)。单链抗体可以是单价的(如果仅使用一个VH和VL)，二价的(如果使用两个VH和VL)，或多价的(如果使用两个以上的VH和VL)。; 在其他的具体实施例中，可使用编码抗-IGF-IR之核酸分子制备其他经过修改的抗体。例如，可使用标准分子生物学技术，依据说明书的教导，制备"κ体"(Ill等人, Protein Eng 10 : 949-57 (1997))、"迷你体(minibodies)"(Martin等人, EMBO J 13 : 5303-9 (1994))、"完全体"(Holliger等人, PNAS USA 90 : 6444-6448 (1993))，或"杰纽辛(Janusin)"(Traunecker等人, EMBO J 10 : 3655-3659 (1991)，和Traunecker等人"Janusin :  new molecular design for bispecific reagents" Int J Cancer Suppl 7 : 51-52 (1992))。; 在其他方面，可产制嵌合型和双重专一的抗体。可制造嵌合型抗体，其包括得自不同抗体的CDRs和架构区。在较佳的具体实施例中，嵌合型抗体的CDRs包括抗-IGF-IR抗体之轻或重链可变区的全部CDRs，而架构区则衍生自一或多个不同的抗体。在更佳的具体实施例中，嵌合型抗体的CDRs包括抗-IGF-IR抗体之轻和重链可变区的全部CDRs。架构区可得自另一个物种，且在较佳的具体实施例中，可以是人类化的。或者，架构区可得自其他的人类抗体。; 可产制双重专一的抗体，其经由一个结合功能部位专一地与IGF-IR结合，并经由第二个结合部位与第二个分子结合。可经由重组分子生物学技术，产制双重专一的抗体，或可以物理方式将其共轭在一起。此外，亦可产制含有一个以上VH和VL的单链抗体，其专一地与IGF-IR和其他分子结合。可使用已知的技术，来产制这类双重专一的抗体，例如关於(i)和(ii)，参见，例如Fanger等人Immunol Methods 4 : 72-81 (1994)，以及Wright和Harris，在前，而关於(iii)，参见，例如Traunecker等人Int. J. Cancer(附录)7 : 51-52 (1992)。在较佳的具体实施例中，双重专一的抗体与IGF-IR结合，并与在癌症或肿瘤细胞中以高程度表现的其他分子结合。在更佳的具体实施例中，其他分子为erbB2受体、VEGF、CD20或EGF-R。; 在一个具体实施例中，使用得自一个选自2.12.1、2.13.2、2.14.3、3.1.1、4.9.2、4.17.3或6.1.1之抗体的一或多个可变区或一或多个CDR区，制备上述经过修改的抗体。在另一个具体实施例中，使用其胺基酸序列出现在序列识别2、4、6、8、10、12、14、16、18、20、22或24号中，或其核酸序列出现在序列识别1、3、5、7、9、11、13、15、17、19、21或23号中的一或多个可变区或一或多个CDR区，制备经过修改的抗体。; 经过衍生和标示的抗体; 本发明之抗体或抗体部份可经过衍生或与其他分子(例如其他的肽或蛋白质)连接。一般而言，衍生抗体或其部份，使得该IGF-IR结合作用不受该衍生作用或标示的不利影响。因此，本发明之抗体和抗体部份企图包括在本文中描述之人类抗-IGF-IR抗体的完整和经过修改之形式。例如，本发明之抗体或抗体部份可在功能上与一或多个其他分子实体连接(藉着化学偶联、遗传融合、非共价结合或其他)，像是其他抗体(例如双重专一的抗体或完全体)、检测剂、细胞毒性制剂、药学制剂，及/或可调节抗体或抗体部份与其他分子之结合的蛋白质或肽(像是链霉菌抗生物素蛋白核区或聚组胺酸标签)。; 藉着将二或多个抗体(相同类型或不同类型的，例如产生双重专一的抗体)交联，产生一型经过衍生的抗体。适当的交联剂包括属於异种双功能的那些，具有两个不同反应性的基团，由适当的间隔基分开(例如间-顺丁烯二醯亚胺苯甲醯基-N-羟基琥珀醯亚胺酯)或同种双功能的(例如二琥珀醯亚胺基辛二酸酯)。这类交联剂可购自Pierce Chemical Company,  Rockford,  Ill。; 其他类型的经过衍生之抗体是经过标示的抗体。可用来衍生本发明之抗体或抗体部份的有用检测剂，包括萤光化合物，包括萤光素、萤光素异硫代氰酸酯、若丹明、5-二甲胺基-1-萘磺醯氯、藻红蛋白、镧系元素磷光体及其类似物。亦可利用可用来检测之酵素标示抗体，像是辣根过氧化酶、β-半乳糖苷酶、虫萤光素酶、硷性磷酸酶、葡萄糖氧化酶及其类似物。当利用可检测酵素标示抗体时，可藉着加入酵素可用来产生可辨别之反应产物的额外试剂来检测。例如，当出现的制剂为辣根过氧化酶时，加入过氧化氢和二胺基联苯胺，导致有颜色的反应产物，其为可检测的。亦可利用生物素标示抗体，并经由抗生物素蛋白或链霉菌抗生物素蛋白的间接测量来检测之。可利用磁性制剂来标示抗体，像是钆。亦可利用可由二级抗体认出的预定之多肽抗原决定位(例如亮胺酸拉链对序列、二级抗体的结合位置、金属结合功能部位、抗原决定位标签)来标示抗体。在一些具体实施例中，藉着各种长度的间隔臂附接标示，降低可能的空间位阻。; 亦可利用放射性标示的胺基酸标示抗-IGF-IR抗体。可为了诊断和治疗目的而使用放射性标示。例如，可使用放射性标示，藉着x-射线或其他诊断技术，检测表现IGF-IR的肿瘤。此外，可在治疗上使用放射性标示，作为对癌性细胞或肿瘤的毒素。多肽之标示的实例，包括但不限於下列的放射性同位素或放射性核素-- 3 H、 14 C、 15 N、 35 S、 90 Y、 99 Tc、 111 In、 125 I、 131 I。; 亦可利用化学基团，像是聚乙二醇(PEG)、甲基或乙基，或碳水化合物基团来衍生抗-IGF-IR抗体。可使用这些基团来改良抗体的生物学特徵，例如增加血清半衰期，或增加组织结合作用。; 医药组合物和套组; 本发明亦关於用来治疗哺乳动物之过度增殖性障碍的医药组合物，其包括在治疗上有效含量的本发明组合物和在药学上可接受的载剂。在一个具体实施例中，该医药组合物可用来治疗诸如脑、肺脏、鳞状细胞、膀胱、胃、胰脏、乳房、头、颈、肾的、肾脏、卵巢、前列腺、结直肠、食道、妇科学的或甲状腺癌之类的癌症。在其他的具体实施例中，该医药组合物系关於非-癌性过度增殖性障碍，像是但不限於在血管造形术之後的再狭窄和牛皮癣。在另一个具体实施例中，本发明系关於用来治疗需要IGF-IR之激活作用的哺乳动物的医药组合物，其中该医药组合物包括在治疗上有效含量的本发明之激活抗体，以及在药学上可接受的载剂。可使用包括激活抗体的医药组合物来治疗缺乏足够IGF-I或IGF-II的动物，或用来治疗骨质疏松症、虚弱，或其中哺乳动物分泌太少的活性生长荷尔蒙，或不能对生长荷尔蒙起反应的障碍。; 可将本发明之抗-IGF-IR抗体并入适合投与个体的医药组合物内。通常，医药组合物包括本发明之抗体和在药学上可接受的载剂。当在本文中使用"在药学上可接受的载剂"时，包括任何或所有的溶剂、分散介质、涂料、抗细菌剂和抗真菌剂、等张和吸收延迟剂，及其类似物，其为在生理学上可相容的。在药学上可接受之载剂的实例包括一或多个水、生理盐水、磷酸缓冲之生理盐水、右旋糖、甘油、乙醇及其类似物，及其组合。在许多案例中，最好在组合物中包括等张剂，例如糖、聚醇，像是甘露糖醇、山梨糖醇或氯化钠。在药学上可接受的物质，像是湿润剂，或少量的辅助物质，像是湿润或乳化剂、防腐剂或缓冲溶液，其提高抗体或抗体部份的储存期限或效力。; 本发明之组合物可以是各种形式的。这些包括例如液态、半-固态和固态剂量形式，像是液态溶液(例如注射用和输液用的溶液)、分散体或悬浮液、锭剂、药丸、散剂、微脂粒和栓剂。较佳的形式依据想要的投药模式和治疗应用而定。通常较佳的组合物是以注射用或输液用溶液的形式，像是类似以其他抗体被动免疫人类所使用的那些组合物。较佳的投药模式为非经肠(例如静脉内、皮下、腹腔内、肌肉内)。在较佳的具体实施例中，藉着静脉内输液或注射投与抗体。在另一个较佳的具体实施例中，藉着肌肉内或皮下注射投与抗体。; 治疗性组合物通常必须是无菌的，并在制造和储存条件下是稳定的。可以溶液、微乳剂、分散体、微脂粒或其他适用於高药物浓度之有秩序结构的形式调配组合物。可藉着以所需之含量，将抗-IGF-IR抗体并入按照需要带有一种上文列举之成份或其组合的适当溶剂中，接着过滤灭菌，来制备无菌注射用溶液。通常，藉着将活性化合物并入无菌的媒剂中，其可含有基本的分散介质，以及在上文列举的那些之中，所需的其他成份，来制备分散体。在用来制备无菌注射用溶液之无菌散剂的案例中，较佳的制备方法是真空脱水和冷冻乾燥，从其先前经过无菌-过滤的溶液中，产生活性成份的散剂，加上任何额外的想要成份。可藉着例如使用诸如卵磷脂之类的涂料，在分散体的案例中藉着维持所需的颗粒尺寸，并藉着使用表面活性剂，来维持适当的溶液流动性。可藉着在组合物中含有延迟吸收的制剂，例如单硬脂酸盐类和明胶，而导致注射用组合物的延长吸收。; 可藉着此项技艺中已知的各种方法，投与本发明之抗体，虽然对许多治疗应用而言，较佳的投药途径/模式为腹腔内、皮下、肌肉内、静脉内或输液。熟谙此艺者应了解投药的途径及/或模式将依据想要的结果而改变。在一个具体实施例中，可以单一剂量的方式投与本发明之抗体，或以多次剂量的方式投与。; 在某些具体实施例中，可利用保护活性化合物对抗迅速释放的载剂来制备该化合物，像是控制释放的调配物，包括植入物、经皮贴片和微量包胶的递送系统。可使用生物可降解的、生物可相容的聚合物，像是乙烯乙酸乙烯酯、聚酐类、聚乙醇酸、胶原蛋白、聚原酸酯和聚乳酸。许多制备这类调配物的方法已取得专利，或通常为熟谙此艺者已知的。参见，例如Sustained and Controlled Release Drug Delivery Systems,  J.R. Robinson编辑, Marcel Dekker,  Inc.,  New York,  1978。; 在某些具体实施例中，可口服投与本发明之抗-IGF-IR，例如，利用惰性稀释剂或可吸收食用之载剂。亦可将化合物(如果想要，和其他成份)包封在硬或软壳的明胶胶囊中、压制成锭剂，或直接并入个体的饮食中。关於口服的治疗性投药，可将化合物与赋形剂合并，并以可摄食之锭剂、口含片、糖锭、胶囊、酏剂、悬浮液、糖浆、糯米纸囊剂，及其类似物的形式使用。欲藉着非经肠投药以外的其他方法投与本发明之化合物，可能必须以保护其免於失活的材料涂覆该化合物，或与该化合物共同-投与。; 亦可将补充的活性化合物并入组合物中。在某些具体实施例中，将本发明之抗-IGF-IR与一或多种额外的治疗剂共同调配，并/或共同投与，像是化学治疗剂、抗赘生物剂或抗-肿瘤制剂。例如，可将抗-IGF-IR抗体与一或多种额外的治疗剂共同调配并/或共同投与。这些制剂包括但不限於与其他标靶结合的抗体(例如与一或多个生长因子或细胞激素，其细胞表面受体或IGF-I结合的抗体)、IGF-I结合蛋白质、抗赘生物剂、化学治疗剂、抗-肿瘤剂、对抗IGF-IR或IGF-I的反义寡核苷酸、阻断IGF-IR激活的肽类似物、可溶性IGF-IR，及/或一或多个抑制IGF-I产制或活性的化学制剂，其为此项技艺中已知的，例如奥曲肽。关於包括激活抗体的医药组合物，可将抗-IGF-IR抗体与增加细胞增殖或预防细胞凋零的因子一起调配。这类因子包括生长因子，像是IGF-I，及/或激活IGF-IR的IGF-I之类似物。这类组合治疗可能需要较低剂量的抗-IGF-IR抗体，以及共同投与之制剂，因此避免了可能的毒性或与各种单一治疗有关的并发症。在一个具体实施例中，抗体和一或多个额外的治疗剂。; 本发明之医药组合物可含有"在治疗上有效之含量"或"在预防上有效之含量"的本发明之抗体或抗体部份。"在治疗上有效之含量"意指在所需的剂量和期间内，达到想要之治疗结果的有效含量。可根据诸如疾病状态、个体的年龄、性别和体重，以及抗体或抗体部份在个体中诱发想要之反应的能力，来改变抗体或抗体部份在治疗上的有效含量。在治疗上有效之含量亦是在治疗上有利之影响胜过抗体或抗体部份之任何毒性或有害影响的含量。"在预防上有效之含量"意指在所需的剂量和期间内，达到想要之预防结果的有效含量。通常，因为在疾病之前或其较早的阶段，对个体使用预防剂量，故在预防上有效之含量将低於在治疗上有效之含量。; 可调整剂量摄生法，以便提供最适切的想要反应(例如治疗或预防的反应)。例如，可投与单一团块，可在一段时间内投与数个分开的剂量，或可按照紧急治疗状况的指示，按比例降低或增加剂量。可为了单一或多次给药，调配包括抗体或包括组合治疗(包括抗体和一或多个额外之治疗剂)的医药组合物。为了易於投药和剂量的均等，以剂量单位形式调配非经肠组合物是特别有利的。当在本文中使用剂量单位时，意指物理上的个别单位，适合待处理之哺乳动物个体的单一剂量；每个单位含有预定含量的活性成份，经过计算其可产生想要的治疗效果，连同所需的药学载剂。藉着并直接依据(a)活性成份的独特特徵和待达成的特殊治疗或预防性效果，以及(b)在个体中为了敏感性的处理，在混合这类活性化合物之技艺中的固有限制，来指示本发明之剂量单位形式的说明书。特别有用的调配物是在20 mM柠檬酸钠，pH 5.5,  140 mM NaCl和0.2毫克/毫升多乙氧基醚80之缓冲溶液中的5毫克/毫升抗-IGF-IR抗体。;

已经在前揭示了抗体或二级抗体的适当标示，并包括各种酵素、辅基、萤光物质、发光物质、磁性制剂和放射性物质。适当之酵素的实例包括辣根过氧化酶、硷性磷酸酶、β-半乳糖苷酶或乙醯胆硷酯酶；适当之辅基复合物的实例包括链霉菌抗生物素蛋白/生物素和抗生物素蛋白/生物素；适当之萤光物质的实例包括繖形酮、萤光素、萤光素异硫代氰酸酯、若丹明、二氯三胺萤光素、丹磺醯氯或藻红蛋白；发光物质的实例包括鲁米诺；磁性制剂的实例包括钆；且适当之放射性物质的实例包括 125 I、 131 I、 35 S或 3 H。; 在另一种选择的具体实施例中，可在生物试样中藉着竞争免疫测定，利用以可检测物质标示的IGF-IR标准物和未标示的抗-IGF-IR抗体，来测定IGF-IR。在该测定中，混合生物试样、已标示之IGF-IR标准物和抗-IGF-IR抗体，并定出已标示之IGF-IR标准物与未标示之抗体结合的量。在该生物试样中IGF-IR的含量，与已标示之IGF-IR标准物与抗-IGF-IR抗体结合的量成反比。; 为了许多目的，可使用上文揭示的免疫测定。在一个具体实施例中，可在细胞培养中使用抗-IGF-IR抗体检测在细胞中的IGF-IR。在较佳的具体实施例中，可在以各种化合物处理细胞之後，使用抗IGF-IR抗体检测在细胞表面上IGF-IR的酪胺酸磷酸化作用、酪胺酸自体磷酸化作用，及/或IGF-IR的含量。可使用该方法测试可用来激活或抑制IGF-IR的化合物。在该方法中，以受试化合物处理一种细胞试样一段时间，同时保持其他试样仍是未处理的。如果欲测量酪胺酸自体磷酸化作用，则将细胞溶解，并使用上述的免疫测定，或按照在实例III中的描述，其使用ELISA，来测量IGF-IR的酪胺酸磷酸化作用。如果欲测量IGF-IR的总量，则将细胞溶解，并使用上述的免疫测定之一，来测量总IGF-IR含量。; 为了定出IGF-IR酪胺酸磷酸化作用，或为了测量总IGF-IR含量，较佳的免疫测定为ELISA或西方墨点法。如果仅测量细胞表面的IGF-IR含量，则不溶解细胞，并使用上述的免疫测定之一来测量细胞表面的IGF-IR含量。定出细胞表面之IGF-IR含量的较佳免疫测定包括以可检测标记标示细胞表面的蛋白质，像是生物素或 125 I，利用抗-IGF-IR抗体使IGF-IR免疫沉淀，然後检测已标示的IGF-IR。为了定出IGF-IR的局部化，例如细胞表面的含量，其他较佳的免疫测定为藉着使用免疫组织化学法。诸如ELISA、RIA、西方墨点法、免疫组织化学法、嵌入膜之蛋白质的细胞表面标示，以及免疫沉淀法之类的方法，为此项技艺中已熟知的。参见，例如Harlow和Lane，在前。此外，亦可为了高输贯量筛选按比例扩大免疫测定，以便就IGF-IR的激活或抑制作用，测试大量的化合物。; 亦可使用本发明之抗-IGF-IR抗体，定出在组织中或在衍生自该组织之细胞中的IGF-IR含量。在较佳的具体实施例中，该组织为肿瘤或其生检试样。在该方法的较佳具体实施例中，从患者中切除该组织或其生检试样。然後在免疫测定中使用该组织或生检试样，藉着上文讨论的方法，决定例如IGF-IR含量、IGF-IR的细胞表面含量、IGF-IR的酪胺酸磷酸化作用程度，或IGF-IR的局部化。可使用该方法决定肿瘤是否以高程度表现IGF-IR。; 可使用上述的诊断方法决定肿瘤是否表现高程度的IGF-IR，这可表示该肿瘤将对利用抗-IGF-IR抗体的处理有良好的反应。亦可使用该诊断方法决定肿瘤是否可能是癌性的(如果其表现高程度的IGF-IR)，或是良性的(如果其表现低程度的IGF-IR)。此外，亦可使用该诊断方法，决定利用抗-IGF-IR抗体的处理(参见下文)，是否引起肿瘤表现较低程度的IGF-IR，及/或表现较低程度的酪胺酸自体磷酸化作用，并因此可用来决定该处理是否是成功的。一般而言，决定抗-IGF-IR抗体是否降低酪胺酸磷酸化作用的方法，包括在改兴趣的细胞或组织中，测量酪胺酸磷酸化作用的程度，将该细胞或组织与抗-IGF-IR抗体或其抗原-结合部份一起培养，然後再度-测量在该细胞或组织中酪胺酸磷酸化作用之程度的步骤。可测量IGF-IR或其他蛋白质(们)的酪胺酸磷酸化作用。亦可使用该诊断方法，决定组织或细胞是否不表现足够高之含量的IGF-IR，或足够高之含量的已激活IGF-IR，这可能是罹患矮小、骨质疏松症或糖尿病之个体的案例。IGF-IR或活性IGF-IR之含量太低的诊断，可使用激活抗-IGF-IR抗体、IGF-I或其他增加IGF-IR含量或活性的治疗剂来治疗之。; 亦可在活体内使用本发明之抗体，使表现IGF-IR的组织和器官局限化。在较佳的具体实施例中，可使用抗-IGF-IR抗体使表现IGF-IR的肿瘤局限化。本发明之抗-IGF-IR抗体的优点是在投与它时，将不产生免疫反应。该方法包括对需要这类诊断试验的患者投与抗-IGF-IR抗体或其医药组合物，并使该患者接受影像分析，定出表现IGF-IR之组织的位置之步骤。影像分析是在医学技艺中已熟知的，并包括但不限於x-射线分析、核磁共振光谱法(MRI)或电脑断层摄影(CE)。在该方法的其他具体实施例中，从患者中获得生检试样，决定感兴趣的组织是否表现IGF-IR，而非使患者接受影像分析。在较佳的具体实施例中，可利用可检测之制剂标示抗-IGF-IR抗体，其可在患者中显影。例如，可利用诸如钡之类的照影剂(其可用於x-射线分析)，或诸如钆螯合物之类的磁性照影剂(其可用於MRI或CE)，来标示抗体。其他的标示剂，包括但不限於放射性同位素，像是 99 Tc。在其他的具体实施例中，抗-IGF-IR抗体将是未标示的，并将藉着投与二级抗体或其他可检测，并可与抗-IGF-IR抗体结合的分子，而使其显影。; 治疗方法的用途; 在其他的具体实施例中，本发明藉着对需要其之患者投与抗-IGF-IR抗体，提供抑制IGF-IR活性的方法。可在治疗上使用在本文中描述的任何类型之抗体。在较佳的具体实施例中，抗-IGF-IR抗体是人类、嵌合型或人类化的抗体。在另一个较佳的具体实施例中，IGF-IR是人类的，且患者是人类患者。或者，患者可以是表现IGF-IR的哺乳动物，且抗-IGF-IR抗体与其产生交叉-反应。可为了兽医的目的，或作为人类疾病的动物模式，对非-人类的、表现与该抗体产生交叉-反应之IGF-IR的哺乳动物(也就是灵长类，或猕猴或恒河猴)投与该抗体。这类动物模式可用来评估本发明之抗体的治疗效力。; 当在本文中使用"其中IGF-IR活性是有害的障碍"一词时，企图包括某种疾病或其他的障碍，其中已经显示在受该障碍所苦的个体中，高含量IGF-IR的出现，是或怀疑是引起该障碍之病理生理学的原因，或是促使该障碍恶化的因素。因此，其中高含量之IGF-IR活性是有害的障碍，是其中预期抑制IGF-IR活性将可改善其症状及/或进行的障碍。例如，可藉着在受该障碍所苦之个体受影响的细胞或组织中，增加在细胞表面上的IGF-IR含量，或增加IGF-IR之酪胺酸自体磷酸化作用，来证实这类障碍。例如，可使用如同上述的抗-IGF-IR抗体，检测在IGF-IR含量上的增加。;

378、Laser accelerator produced colliding ion beams fusion device
摘要：A fusion device consisting of two colliding ion beams,  each produced by a high power,  femtosecond regime,  chirped pulsed amplification (CPA) laser acceleration device. The CPA laser creates an ionized plasma and subsequently accelerates electrons to multi-MeV energies,  thus creating electric fields due to separation of electrons and ions,  of sufficient magnitude to accelerate the plasma ions to energies ranging from multi-keV to multi-MeV levels. The magnetic fields created by the laser pulses,  as well as the electrons and/or ions,  also helps confine the ions to the region of the size of the laser beam focal spot diameter,  and thus enhance the collision probability of the counter-streaming ions and provide a sizable population of fusion events. Ion beam generation by high powered,  short pulse CPA lasers has been previously demonstrated in thin foil targets. This novel use of the colliding beam geometry should lead to near break-even levels of fusion energy production in compact geometry suitable for small laboratory use for weapons design applications and commercial fusion energy characterization emulations. In addition,  the low emittance of any radiation produced in the small fusion reaction region could provide a significant feature for use of this technology in high resolution neutron radiography,  or other commercial or medical applications of neutrons,  ions,  electrons or photons(5) produced by components of this technology. It should be noted that the ion beam(s) created with only one foil target could produce neutrons for radiography by other than fusion reactions;  for example for protons,  (p, n) reactions on the target atoms will produce a neutron source of varying energies,  although the cross sections for the reactions may be somewhat lower than for fusion.

381、METHOD FOR CONDUCTING THERMONUCLEAR REACTION IN MAGNETIC FUSION REACTOR
摘要：FIELD :  controlled fusion;  extracting fusion energy,  generating three-dimensional neutron sources (for instance to recover nuclear wastes). SUBSTANCE :  method involves irradiation of heavy particles of fuel pellets injected in reactor chamber wherein high pressure of working gas not lower than atmospheric pressure is maintained using laser pulses or beams for the purpose. In the process problems of production of hot plasma,  maintenance of inertialess current,  and monitoring of plasma-magnetic configuration are solved. Circuit arrangement of magnetic fusion reactor of proposed type enables directly placing the installation in steady state running dispensing with rather sophisticated standard scheme of organizing hot plasma (gas breakdown at low working gas pressure,  preheating of plasma with ohmic current,  and the like). Proposed reactor enables combining advantages of magnetic heat insulation and near-wall plasma confinement implemented by building up so-called high- pressure gas cushion at plasma boundary. Proposed method may be found useful for installations with magnetic field configuration of tokamak,  stellarator,  or adiabatic trap type. Near-wall plasma confinement used in tokamaks makes it possible to avoid dangerous instability of discharge failure. As rather high pressure (and density) of plasma can be maintained in proposed reactor (compared with traditional magnetic confinement of plasma),  this reactor can be used for conducting fusion reactions at low section of reactions (for instance in case of D+He3 nuclei fusion reaction). EFFECT :  enlarged functional capabilities. 1 cl,  1 dwg

摘要：PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED :  To reduce a number of laser beams to simplify a structure and operation control by condensing laser light in a vacuum vessel to a pellet which has occluded nuclear fusion fuel to cause high density nuclear fusion reaction.SOLUTION :  A pellet 3 is made of a solid material which has occluded nuclear fusion fuel and coated by a coating material to prevent a temperature from rising.

摘要：Equipment for electrical energy production by electrocatalytic fusion of deuterium includes a chamber (1) which contains deuterium and a system (2,  2' ) for focussing two laser beams with rotary quadripolar modes having the chamber axis as common axis. One beam (with a wavelength 10 times that of the other) generates a plasma column which forms,  at its centre,  the target,  on which is concentrated the energy of the other beam. This other beam causes ignition and consequent propagation of electronic shock waves (spikes) which cause renewed nuclear fusion and creation of current pulses. The current pulses are received by the internal conductors (5,  5' ) of two coaxial cables,  the external conductors (6,  6' ) of which surround the tubes (4,  4' ) in which the spikes propagate fusion. The focussing system comprises mirrors (3,  3' ) which have centre openings for passage of the spikes and which reflect the laser beams so that the lasers can be positioned outside the spike trajectory.

441、DEVICE CAUSING AND USING “MICROFUSION” THERMONUCLAIRE
摘要：The nuclear fusion generator comprises a chamber (1) filled with deuterium which is concentrated in a  central volume (F) by a magnetic field and formed into a plasma by a first layer beam. A second laser beam,   whose wavelength is one tenth as long at that of the first beam,  is directed onto the plasma from the opposite  direction,  and both beams are focussed by devices which modify their electric components so that they vary in a  rotating quadripolar fashion. This causes rapidly intermittent fusion reactions accompanied by the release of  pulses of electric current. The pulses are picked up by a pair of anodes (9) spaced from opposite ends of the  plasma and at least one cathode (15) extending radially up to the central part of the plasma,  to create a  pulsed electric current as a power output.

摘要：Commercial and medical use of discharge-pumped lasers such as excimer lasers,  metal vapor lasers,  and pulsed CO2 lasers has resulted in the demand for increased repetition rates to provide increased total power output. Increased repetition rates,  however,  also result in greater losses in magnetic cores used to drive these lasers. The use of air cooling with known magnetic core configurations is inadequate to cool the magnetic cores. As a result,  the excessive temperature rise of the magnetic core material results in undesirable changes in the magnetic properties such as reduced saturation induction. In addition,  the excessive temperature rise may compromise the insulation materials either on the wire windings or interlaminar insulation within the magnetic core itself.The present invention provides a magnetic core which has improved cooling within the current cross-sectional area and length of cores used in lasers and which requires no cooling fluid. The present magnetic core comprises at least two concentric corelets wherein the corelets are formed of magnetic amorphous metal alloy and are substantially separated by a gas passage. The present magnetic cores are useful in various pulse power applications including in high power pulse sources for linear induction particle accelerators,  as induction modules for coupling energy from the pulse source to the beam of these accelerators,  as magnetic switches in power generators for inertial confinement fusion research,  and in magnetic modulators for driving excimer lasers,  metal vapor lasers,  and pulsed CO2 assembly line lasers.

471、METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR GENERATING NUCLEAR FUSION ENERGY BY COHERENT BOSONS
摘要：With an extremely short laser pulse with not too high an intensity it is possible to ionize deuterium,  or helium into coherent bosons such as coherent deuterons and coherent alpha particles. To achieve this coherence it is important that certain critical conditions are satisfied so that plasma instabilities such as stimulated Raman scattering,  stimulated Brillouin scattering,  parametric instability have not enough time to grow to destroy the coherence. The electrons created during the multiphoton ionization process also must not recombine with the ions or to destroy the coherence of the ions by electromagnetic scattering. With the creation of coherent deuterons and coherent alpha particles together,  the fusion rate of coherent deuterons into coherent alpha particles will be greatly enhanced. The nuclear fusion energy thus released can be utilized.

摘要：PURPOSE :  To measure electron density by low output laser beam by repeatedly irradiating an object to be measured by the laser beam reciprocating between first and second reflecting mirrors. CONSTITUTION :  Laser beam L is reflected by a polarizing element 23 to be incident on a polarization control element 24. This beam is circularly polarized to transmit through the element 24 and reflected by a first reflecting mirror 26 to be again incident on the element 24 to become linear polarized beam rotated by 90°. The polarized beam is reflected to be incident on a vacuum container 29 from a window 30 to scatter the electron of an object to be measured. This scattered beam S is incident on a spectroscope 32. The residual beam L is reflected by a second reflecting mirror 33 and this reflected beam is reflected by the first reflecting mirror 6 to be again incident on the container 29 to generate new beam S. That is,  the beam L repeatedly reciprocates between the mirrors 26,  33 to generate the beam S incident on the container 29. The beam S is spectrally diffracted by the spectroscope 32 and the respective spectrum components are integrated corresponding to the number of the generated beams S. Therefore,  even the weak beam S becomes measurable intensity and electron density can be measured without enhancing the output of the beam L.

摘要：PURPOSE :  To quickly locate damaged or worn portion and quantitatively determine the condition by holding a visual sensor in the direction at right angles to a slit laser beam receiving section and moving the sensor in parallel with a wall to be measured. CONSTITUTION :  The image of the surface of a tile 1 is taken for a slit to obtain the coordinates (P11,  P12) of both edges of the tile 1. The attitude of a hand is then changed so that the z axis in which a visual sensor is directed is perpendicular to the straight lines P11,  P12. Taking the image of the surface of the tile 1 for a slit again,  the edge points P11,  P12 are measured. Then a hand is moved to a point without changing attitude by a certain distance in the direction x in the sensor coordinate system to take the image of the tile 1 surface for a slit to measure the tile 1 edge points P21,  P22. The attitude of the hand is then changed so that the line P11,  P12 is the y axis and the direction of P21 is the x axis. Movement in the x axis direction with the hand attitude unchanged enables calculation of all the measured data by the difference only in the z axis.

491、NUCLEAR FUEL REPROCESSING PLANT
摘要：PURPOSE :  To improve the extent of anticorrosion against a nitric acid solution in a weld part by radiating a laser beam to the weld part of a plant member used with austenitic stainless steel with molybdenum added,  and heating a surface layer. CONSTITUTION :  When molybdenum is added,  a boundary part of the cell or arborescent dendritic structure of a weld metal is selectively corroded so markedly but this corrosive deterioration goes out if it is subjected to heat treatment at a temperature of more than 1000°C after welding. Accordingly,  a laser beam is radiated on a weld part 3 of the member formed by Mo added stainless steel,  and a surface layer is heated. The laser beam shifts its focal point to some extent in order to heat is uniformly,  and an area to be irradiated is set to be area sufficiently covering the weld part 3. In order to shorten a span of processing time,  a temperature for heat treatment is heightened in a range where fusion will not occur. It is desirable that depth of an effective heat treatment layer 17 is more than 0.5 mm from the surface. With this constitution,  the corrosive deterioration in the weld part is eliminable,  while heating is limited to the surface alone,  thus harmful thermal deformation is preventable.

516、Hybrid-drive implosion system for ICF targets
摘要：Hybrid-drive implosion systems (20, 40) for ICF targets (10, 22, 42) are described which permit a significant increase in target gain at fixed total driver energy. The ICF target is compressed in two phases,  an initial compression phase and a final peak power phase,  with each phase driven by a separate,  optimized driver. The targets comprise a hollow spherical ablator (12) surroundingly disposed around fusion fuel (14). The ablator is first compressed to higher density by a laser system (24),  or by an ion beam system (44),  that in each case is optimized for this initial phase of compression of the target. Then,  following compression of the ablator,  energy is directly delivered into the compressed ablator by an ion beam driver system (30, 48) that is optimized for this second phase of operation of the target. The fusion fuel (14) is driven,  at high gain,  to conditions wherein fusion reactions occur. This phase separation allows hydrodynamic efficiency and energy deposition uniformity to be individually optimized,  thereby securing significant advantages in energy gain. In additional embodiments,  the same or separate drivers supply energy for ICF target implosion. -GOVT PAR The U.S. Government has rights to this invention pursuant to Contract No. W-7405-ENG-48 between the U.S. Department of Energy and the University of California,  for the operation of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

摘要：A high-power-density laser or charged-particle-beam fusion reactor system maximizes the directed kinetic energy imparted to a large mass of liquid lithium by a centrally located fusion target. A fusion target is embedded in a large mass of lithium,  of sufficient radius to act as a tritium breeding blanket,  and provided with ports for the access of beam energy to implode the target. The directed kinetic energy is converted directly to electricity with high efficiency by work done against a pulsed magnetic field applied exterior to the lithium. Because the system maximizes the blanket thickness per unit volume of lithium,  neutron-induced radioactivities in the reaction chamber wall are several orders of magnitude less than is typical of other fusion reactor systems. -GOVT PAC BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION PAR The U.S. Government has righgts in this invention pursuant to Contract No. W-7405-ENG-48 between the U.S. Department of Energy and the University of California,  for the operation of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

摘要：PURPOSE :  To decrease the generation of the cracks in a weld zone by specifying the ratio between the melting diameter and fusion width of the nugget in the weld zone at a specific value or below thereby setting welding conditions. CONSTITUTION :  The nugget is welded to the sealing part of a gimbal 2 of a thin sheet spring and a spacer 5 by laser beam welding to form the weld zone 1. The irradiation energy density of laser light is so controlled in this stage that the ratio between the melting diameter B on the surface of the gimbal 2 and the fusion width A of the spacer 5 attains ≤1.4. The cracks D generated in the laser weld zone 1 increase sharply when the ratio B/A of the diameter B and the width A exceeds 1.4. The generation of the cracks D in the weld zone 1 is thus prevented by adopting the laser welding condition under which the value of the B/A is specified at ≤1.4.

537、Pulsed nuclear power plant
摘要：A spherical underground cavity is filled with saturated steam or a mixture of saturated steam and coal dust in which a nuclear device is detonated to provide the source of energy. The energy thus released heats the saturated steam to produce superheated steam used to generate power. If coal dust is mixed with the saturated steam in the correct ratio,  the rise in temperature caused by the nuclear explosion initiates a chemical reaction between the steam and the coal to produce carbon monoxide and hydrogen. The mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen can be used as fuel in an external power plant. The carbon monoxide and the hydrogen gases can also be separated for use as fuels or for industrial applications. The wall of the spherical underground cavity is isolated from the shock wave created by the nuclear explosion in the ambient saturated steam by a segmented steel shell. Each segments is supported by a shock absorbing mechanism attached to the rocks in which the cavity is embedded. After the explosion,  the steel shell segments move outward,  are slowed down and stopped by the shock absorbing system. No shock is transmitted to the surrounding rocks. The shell segments are eventually returned to their initial position and readied for the next explosion. After enough superheated steam has been extracted out of the cavity,  water and saturated steam are again injected inside the cavity,  to restore the initial ambient conditions that existed prior to the preceding explosion. When the conditions inside the cavity are right,  another nuclear device is introduced,  then detonated and another cycle is started. The explosion cycle frequency is established by the size of the cavity and the yield of the nuclear device. Most,  and possibly even all,  of the energy thus generated is produced by a nuclear reaction of the fusion type. Means is thereby provided to produce energy and possibly more fuels by utilizing the inexpensive and plentiful fuel deuterium. If a fission reaction is not used to trigger the fusion reaction,  tritium may need to be added to the deuterium so that a powerful laser beam can be used to provide the triggering means.

551、Method for the release of thermonuclear energy combining impact,  magnetic and inertial confinement fusion
摘要：In the invention,  first a relatively large mass is accelerated to a few 10 km/sec and then used to implode and compress a dense magnetized plasma confined inside a small cavity. In the proposed invention the dense plasma shall consist of thermonuclear material,  as for example DT,  and shall reach upon compression the temperature for thermonuclear ignition. The magnetized plasma is thereby permitted to be preheated by a laser or particle beam or a gas discharge to reduce the required compression to reach thermonuclear ignition. After having reached the ignition temperature the plasma undergoes a thermonuclear burn excursion,  greatly increasing its energy content. During this excursion a small window in the wall of the chamber confining the burning plasma breaks open releasing a large amount of the energy within the cavity in the form of black body radiation and shock waves. The energy flux from both the black body radiation and the shock wave is then used to ablatively implode a second stage high density high yield thermonuclear target. The importance of this two stage arrangement is that it permits much higher yields than would be possible with a one stage magnetized target.

554、Method for the initiation of fusion reactions for the controlled release of energy
摘要：The invention relates to a novel method for the controlled release of thermonuclear energy by inertial confinement. The essential feature of the invention is that is uses for the achievement of this goal high temperature black body radiation. The black body radiation is generated by hypervelocity impact onto a tenuous gas trapped inside a small cavity. The tenuous gas is shock-heated to high temperatures and thereby becomes a source of intense photon radiation,  which after reaching thermodynamic equilibrium becomes a black body radiation. The thusly generated black body radiation is the furthermore amplified by adiabatic compression through the implosion of the cavity. During the implosion process the photons inside the cavity must be sufficiently well confined by the opacity of the cavity wall which sets a lower limit for the implosion velocity. The thusly created and amplified black body radiation is then used to ablatively implode and ignite a thermonuclear target placed inside the cavity. Because the attainable black body radiation temperatures typically reach values of .apprxeq. 1 keV,  the corresponding short photon wave length should with much greater ease permit high density target compression than with other proposed drivers. The cavity implosion itself can be driven by any one of the available sources hitherto proposed for inertial confinement fusion,  including laser beams,  beams of charged particles and hypervelocity projectiles,  but unlike in case of direct pellet fusion with a greatly reduced power and power density.

摘要：The field of application of the weapon laser is extended to include dealing with the hollow folded beam lithium laser of the two-frame disintegrated type. A known folded beam lithium nuclear laser amplifier is started at its back as a secondary amplifier for a full-beam L5 optically pumped,  known polycyclic primary light amplifier with 50 to 1000 kJ light energy. A converter changes the beam to a hollow beam which is converted in the secondary laser into a hollow folded beam by fusion of lithium hydride or deuteride wire or other fusion wire,  which delivers plasma for pumping the inversion in the laser gas. The primary laser is therefore developed to assist the secondary nuclear as a starting laser and primary amplifier at the starting ramp.

摘要：A piston is moved by a laser incited fusion reaction such as deuterium-tritium (D-T) to thereby produce an expandable fusion chamber. When a gaseous substance such as CO.sub.2 is presented in the presence of the fusion reaction,  it is dissociated into CO and O.sub.2 component mixture and the expansion of the chamber rapidly cools the mixture and quenches the back reaction thereby producing a greater CO yield. Also the piston produces peripheral power from the fusion reaction in the form of mechanical energy.

563、Solenoidal fusion system
摘要：This invention discloses apparatus and methods to produce nuclear fusion utilizing fusible material in the form of high energy ion beams confined in magnetic fields. For example,  beams of deuterons and tritons are injected in the same direction relative to the axis of a vacuum chamber. The ion beams are confined by the magnetic fields of long solenoids. The products of the fusion reactions,  such as neutrons and alpha particles,  escape to the wall surrounding the vacuum chamber,  producing heat. The momentum of the deuterons is approximately equal to the momentum of the tritons,  so that both types of ions follow the same path in the confining magnetic field. The velocity of the deuteron is sufficiently greater than the velocity of the triton so that overtaking collisions occur at a relative velocity which produces a high fusion reaction cross section. Electrons for space charge neutralization are obtained by ionization of residual gas in the vacuum chamber,  and additionally from solid material (irradiated with ultra-violet light or other energetic radiation) adjacent to the confinement region. For start-up operation,  injected high-energy molecular ions can be dissociated by intense laser beam,  producing trapping via change of charge state. When sufficiently intense deuteron and triton beams have been produced,  the laser beam can be removed,  and subsequent change of charge state can be achieved by collisions (circulating and injected beams).

The count rates are related to the tritium content and the pressurization. The tritium content in terms of the mass of the tritium in the target can be derived from the counting rate.

566、Nuclear fusion reactor
摘要：A rapidly pulsed nuclear fusion reaction system including a firing chamber into which synchronized opposing beams of ionized gas such as deuterium/tritium are injected in the form of ion pulses which are adapted to collide at the mid point of the chamber. The pulsed ion beams are fed through respective orifices across which is applied a relatively high DC voltage. External to the firing chamber is means for generating a pulsed magnetic field interiorally of the chamber along the ion travel path and in synchronism therewith to provide a guiding effect of the two opposing ion beams to the precise center of the firing chamber. At the moment the leading edges of the ion beams meet,  an electric arc is developed due to the voltage applied across the orifice. The arc strips electrons from the ions and an electron sheath acting to increase the packing fractions of the beams is formed between the orifices leaving bare nuclei to accumulate in density which are further confined by the action of the electron sheath itself. A fuel gas ball is thus formed at the center of the firing chamber which is then ignited to fusion temperature by a pair of lasers or a pair of high energy electron beams. The resulting release of energy is collected as heat at the outer surface of the firing chamber by means of the structure comprising the magnetic field generating means which is also adapted to capture neutrons.

567、High energy anti-rocket,  anti-aircraft beam - obtd. from thermonuclear reaction by pumped laser in cryogenic low temp. chamber
摘要：A weapons laser for antiaircraft and antirocket defence,  operates by nuclear pumping with plasma components of a nuclear-thermonuclear reaction pellet. The laser beam strikes the pellet and generates plasma which expands to pass into the pump chamber. At the same time some plasma passes the supersonic head of the nozzle into the vacuum chamber of a vacuum pump with high redn. of pressure accompanied by expansion cooling. The vacuum in the pump chamber is 5-500 torr. The double-walled container surrounding the pump chamber,  together with cavities in the head of the nozzle and its support arms,  all contain circulating liquified gas,  esp. a mixture of CO and N2. This gas escapes and vaporises through valves to constitute laser-active gas in the pump chamber. The gas forms a central axial laser gas column at low pressure between end reflectors,  which is surrounded by the plasma flowing in at the head. Interchange takes place between the plasma vortex and the central laser gas column the pumping time of 5-10 milliseconds gives the central laser gas no opportunity to form temp. and/or pressure gradients,  so that a laser beam is pumped along the gas column at 80-150 K and 10-250 torr pressure. At the partially transparent mirror at the end of the chamber,  this beam is split,  resulting in up to 30%,  of the plasma energy being converted into light energy.

568、Thermonuclear pump for large scale fusion - has highly conducting tubular casing to improve electromagnetic pinch
摘要：The parent patent describes a thermonuclear pump for large scale fusion,  utilising either the thermal energy or the neutron avalanche produced by microfusion of the Los Alamos fusion test type. This enables a subcritical mass to be detonated. In this patent of addition,  the plasma guide tube is of electrically conducting material (such as Cu,  al or Ti) and is equipped with external electrodes at its ends,  connected to a HF source. A HF short-circuit current flows along the tube,  producing magnetic field lines,  surrounding the tube and interacting with the magnetic field lines of the negatively and positively charged particles of the plasma flowing in a continuous direction along the tube. The effect is to produce an electromagnetic pinch upon the charged particles,  forcing them with an alternate but very high frequency action towards the core of the tube,  the hotter components being towards the centre of the cooler around the periphery. Collectors mounted insulated inside the tube near the external electrodes are connected to a DC or AC circuit which is thus supplied with the energy from the kinetic inertia of the plasma. The pump can be used as a reinforcing cartridge in plasma reservoirs,  fusion reactors and plasma lasers. By substituting Cu,  Al or Ti for the ferromagnetic pole change reinforcement of the parent patent,  a much higher frequency is obtd. of the pole change relative to the fast-flowing plasma.

575、Process for the fabrication of thermonuclear fuel pellets and the product thereof
摘要：In processes utilizing a source of laser energy for achieving a thermonuclear fusion reaction,  it is necessary to have fusion fuel prepared in a configuration with minute dimensions and the present invention contemplates preparing this fuel by introducing into hollow microspheres (typically comprised of glass) of predetermined size,  in the range of 250 to 2, 000 micrometers,  a gaseous thermonuclear fuel. One way of accomplishing this is to cause diffusion of gaseous thermonuclear fuel through the walls of the microsphere under conditions of suitable temperature and pressure so that it may be achieved in a reasonable time,  after which the fuel can be frozen out on the walls of the microsphere to provide a fusion fuel in a hollow spherical shape. Suitable coatings of additional materials may be applied to the fueled microsphere by appropriate coating methods to complete complex thermonuclear fuel pellet configurations.

581、Fusion reaction by implosion of hollow droplets - of fuel carrier liquid with high viscosity and low vapour pressure
摘要：Controlled initiation of a fusion reaction in the central region of imploding,  periodically produced droplets of highly viscous liquid fuel carrier having a vacuum central region is claimed. The central space of the droplets is produced to a high level of vacuum,  before the implosion commences,  by the prodn. of a hollow jet of the fuel carrier liquid from an annular nozzle with central core. The liq. of the droplet is kept cold and shielded from an input of thermal energy;  the complete spherical symmetry of the implosion process is stabilised by high viscosity of the imploding liquid until very high centripetal speeds are attained;  in a slow phase prior to the implosion,  during which slow centripetal movement of the liquid occurs under the influence of surface tension,  the absolute spherical symmetry of the droplet is maintained;  very short,  highly intense laser bombardment evaporates the substance of the droplet in and near its surface and the water surrounding the droplet,  thus producing an explosive action which initiates the energetic implosion;  the droplet substance is a compound having a high content of atomic nuclei capable of fusion,  and the liquid droplet substance is a material with a very low vapour pressure. Pref. the periodic prodn. of the hollow droplets is generated by an ultrasonic emitter producing high-energy ultra sound with a tuned frequency such that the jet of the liquid is periodically broken down into the hollow droplets. Used in particular for the prodn. of a fusion reaction by a travelling,  centripetal shock wave in a mixt. predominantly of deuterium and tritium. By suitable selection of the droplet geometry,  high viscosity and high vacuum in the central region,  much higher temps. can be attained than previously. Much higher droplet densities are obtd. The supply of fuel to the reaction vessel is easily and rapidly regulated. Wall destruction and wall corrosion of the appts. disappear since the solid wall is completely protect ed by a sufficient amount of water shielding from neutral action and radiation damage. The process can be caried out using deuterium only,  thus eliminating the problems of storing gaseous tritium.

584、Methods and apparatus for the control and analysis of X-rays
摘要：Fast X-ray excitation processes such as occur during nuclear fusion reactions where high energy laser pulses hit a target,  as for the purpose of stimulating atomic emission,  may be analyzed by interposing a crystal in the path of the X-rays. The X-rays are transmitted through this crystal by means of the anomalous transmission or Bormann effect. A periodic strain field is established in the crystal to enable or inhibit anomalous transmission. The transmitted radiation is received by a measurement system which is operated in synchronism with the strain field. A solid state shuttering mechanism is obtained which rapidly interrupts the X-rays so that they can be measured even when produced by fast X-ray excitation processes. Various methods and apparatus for producing the periodic strain field are described,  particularly electrostrictive techniques,  piezoelectric techniques using separate transducers mounted on the crystal or the piezoelectric properties of the crystal itself and techniques for stimulating acoustic vibration by means of an optical beam.

摘要：1482526 Thermonuclear fusion UNITED KINGDOM ATOMIC ENERGY AUTHORITY 3 Dec 1974 [5 Dec 1973] 56350/73 Heading G6P A thermonuclear fusion reactor,  especially. one having a toroidal configuration,  is refuelled by subjecting a pellet 1 of a suitable fuel to a pulse 3 of laser energy of such intensity and duration as to vaporize a portion 4 of the pellet,  and that the temperature distribution throughout the pellet remains non-uniform and of such direction that resultant forces on the pellet 1 direct it into the reactor. As a result of vaporization of material from the hotter region 4,  the remainder of the pellet 1 experiences a net reaction which accelerates the pellet along the direction of travel of the laser pulse 3. Some contribution is also made by radiation pressure. Guidance of the pellet 1 is effected by an annular beam 2 of laser light;  this can be simulated by a number of parallel mode-locked guiding beams disposed regularly about the circumference of a circle. The pellet may comprise solid hydrogen fuel.

607、PROCESS FOR THE FABRICATION OF THERMO-NUCLEAR FUEL PELLETS AND THE PRODUCT THEREOF
摘要：In processes utilizing a source of laser energy for achieving a thermonuclear fusion reaction,  it is necessary to have fusion fuel prepared in a configuration with minute dimensions and the present invention contemplates preparing this fuel by introducing into hollow microspheres (typically comprised of glass) of predetermined size,  in the range of 250 to 2, 000 micrometers,  a gaseous thermonuclear fuel.  One way of accomplishing this is to cause permeation of gaseous thermonuclear fuel through the walls of the microsphere under conditions of suitable temperature and pressure that it may be achieved in a reasonable time,  after which the fuel can be frozen out on the walls of the microsphere to provide a fusion fuel in a hollow spherical shape.  Suitable coatings  of additional materials may be applied to the fueled microsphere by appropriate coating methods to complete complex thermonuclear fuel pellet configuration.

摘要：1492785 Hydrogen TEXAS GAS TRANSMISSION CORP 29 Aug 1974 [9 Nov 1973] 37833/74 Heading ClA [Also in Divisions C5 and G6] Hydrogen is produced by decomposition of H 2 O into H 2  and O 2  by exposure of the H 2 O to energy from a nuclear fusion reaction. The hydrogen may be reacted with carbon,  CO,  or CO 2  to form a hydrocarbon fuel. In the apparatus shown,  a fusion pellet is introduced into reaction chamber 10 from injection device 32 and is fired by laser energy directed through tube 38. Water vapour present in chamber 10 is decomposed and the gases issue through separation nozzle 14 which may be designed for supersonic flow,  oxygen being removed at 18 and hydrogen led to methanation plant 47. The nozzle may include a grid of ZrO 2  ceramic through which O 2  diffuses more rapidly than H 2 . The chamber 10 is surrounded by a lithium blanket 20,  lithium being circulated through heat exchanger 76 and tritium separation plant 82 and used to heat plant 84 where water is decomposed into H 2  and O 2 . This decomposition is assisted by radiolytic converter 90 driven by gamma rays and alpha particles generated in neutron conversion chamber 92. The plant 84 is also heated by nuclear energy from loop 24 connected by pipes 86,  88. Hydrogen and oxygen are also produced in radiolysis blanket 28 and separated at 100. Water is introduced into chamber 60 where it boils and decomposes partially into H 2  and O 2 ;  separation takes place at 66,  the residual water vapour being led by pipe 72 into reaction chamber 10. A carbon-containing material,  e.g. coal or limestone,  passes through channel 40 where it is heated to produce carbon or carbon dioxide which is directed to chamber 47 where it reacts with hydrogen from the chamber 10 to form methane. In the apparatus of Fig. 2 (not shown),  the channel 40 is replaced by a further jacket (110) round the chamber 10 through which a heat transfer medium,  e.g. lead,  circulates and heats the carbonaceous material in an external heat exchanger (116).

648、PRODUCTION OF HYDROGEN-BASED GASEOUS FUEL
摘要：1492785 Hydrogen TEXAS GAS TRANSMISSION CORP 29 Aug 1974 [9 Nov 1973] 37833/74 Heading ClA [Also in Divisions C5 and G6] Hydrogen is produced by decomposition of H 2 O into H 2  and O 2  by exposure of the H 2 O to energy from a nuclear fusion reaction. The hydrogen may be reacted with carbon,  CO,  or CO 2  to form a hydrocarbon fuel. In the apparatus shown,  a fusion pellet is introduced into reaction chamber 10 from injection device 32 and is fired by laser energy directed through tube 38. Water vapour present in chamber 10 is decomposed and the gases issue through separation nozzle 14 which may be designed for supersonic flow,  oxygen being removed at 18 and hydrogen led to methanation plant 47. The nozzle may include a grid of ZrO 2  ceramic through which O 2  diffuses more rapidly than H 2 . The chamber 10 is surrounded by a lithium blanket 20,  lithium being circulated through heat exchanger 76 and tritium separation plant 82 and used to heat plant 84 where water is decomposed into H 2  and O 2 . This decomposition is assisted by radiolytic converter 90 driven by gamma rays and alpha particles generated in neutron conversion chamber 92. The plant 84 is also heated by nuclear energy from loop 24 connected by pipes 86,  88. Hydrogen and oxygen are also produced in radiolysis blanket 28 and separated at 100. Water is introduced into chamber 60 where it boils and decomposes partially into H 2  and O 2 ;  separation takes place at 66,  the residual water vapour being led by pipe 72 into reaction chamber 10. A carbon-containing material,  e.g. coal or limestone,  passes through channel 40 where it is heated to produce carbon or carbon dioxide which is directed to chamber 47 where it reacts with hydrogen from the chamber 10 to form methane. In the apparatus of Fig. 2 (not shown),  the channel 40 is replaced by a further jacket (110) round the chamber 10 through which a heat transfer medium,  e.g. lead,  circulates and heats the carbonaceous material in an external heat exchanger (116). Specification 1, 492, 786 is referred to.

650、Short laser pulse generation by gas breakdown switching and highly selective spectral filtering
摘要：In a laser pulse generator,  short pulses adjustable in the range between about 0.1 and 0.5 nanoseconds are produced by improved spectral filtering of the output of a gas breakdown switch. The spectral filter in one embodiment is a hot,  linearly absorbing gas cell that passes both sidebands of the radiation producing the gas breakdown in the switch and that linearly absorbs the center frequency. A second embodiment uses a tandem dual-slit monochromator as the spectral filter in order to pass both sidebands. The hot gas cell is simpler,  cheaper and characterized by a higher rejection ratio than any other alternative to date. It yields very clean pulses with a steeper leading edge than prior techniques. The leading edge is highly reproducible,  as needed for nuclear fusion work. The advantage over prior pulsed CO.sub.2 lasers for nuclear fusion work is substantial,  since those prior lasers have not achieved pulse durations less than one nanosecond.

651、PULSED MULTILINE CO2 LASER OSCILLATOR APPARATUS AND METHOD
摘要：PULSED MULTILANE CO2 LASER OSCILLATOR APPARATUS AND METHOD An apparatus and method for producing a multiline output from a CO2 laser comprising an optical resonant cavity containing gaseous CO2,  means for producing a controlled electrical glow discharge within the gas,  such as Rogowski profile electrodes connected to a high voltage source,  preferably mode locking means such as an acoustooptic modulator,  and means within the cavity for producing a wavelength dependent loss,  such as a Fabry-Perot etalon filter.  The apparatus and method disclosed in the specification greatly increase the efficiency of energy extraction from large CO2 laser amplifiers such as those contemplated for use in inducing nuclear fusion. The means for producing wavelength dependent loss within the laser oscillator cavity lowers the net gain of the usually dominant P(20) transition enough to allow the P(16),  P(18),  P(22),  and P(24) transitions to successfully compete for available upper state population.  In prior art pulsed laser oscillators,  only the P(20) transition reached laser threshold because of its anomalously high gain coefficient at the expense of the remainder of the nearby rotational transitions.  Thus in prior art lasers,  the P(20) line dominated the output in all gain switched and mode locked Transverse Excited Atmospheric (TEA) laser oscillators,  including electron beam controlled devices.

652、High velocity reaction process - using various means to create purely kinetic or thermal energy
摘要：Chemical,  technical and physical process for raising the velocity of reactions is applicable to all types of reaction-solids,  liqs. and gases,  and allows controlled reactions in the required direction. It permits a relatively small initiator by using special surfaces to be used for explosive charges and this can be used in simple weapons. The energy thus generated can be used as propellant (kinetic energy) or as purely thermal energy,  or as a desired balance of the two. The process can be used to alter the properties of solids and gases,  e.g. decay time. It can be used to obt. previously unobtainable temps. and to create high temp. plasma. It can be used for nuclear fusion. By detonation,  a desired spatial direction can be achieved. These processes can be achieved by ultrasonic,  high frequency,  induction,  magnetic fields and lasers instead of current effects. Purely kinetic energy can be balanced.

The latter means comprises a disc 15 rotated by a constant-speed motor 21,  the disc leaving conducting and non-conducting zones arranged to perform a switching function in a circuit for energizing a coil 18 which surrounds the barrel. If the bullet traverses a length D of the barrel in a predetermined time,  no energization of the coil takes place,  but if the bullet travels faster than its predetermined correct velocity,  the coil is energized to create a magnetic drag on the bullet. This speed-control system is designed for use in an apparatus,  Fig. 1 (not shown),  wherein three guns,  all intended to be fired simultaneously and to have their bullets controlled to the same speed,  are used to cause three deuterium and/or tritium pellets mounted on the bullets to come together at a given instant,  laser radiation being trained on the point of impact of the pellets just before they collide.

684、Producing X-rays
摘要：A method of producing X-rays by directing radiant energy from a laser onto a target. Conversion efficiency of at least about 3 percent is obtained by providing the radiant energy in a low-power precursor pulse of approximately uniform effective intensity focused onto the surface of the target for about 1 to 30 nanoseconds so as to generate an expanding unconfined coronal plasma having less than normal solid density throughout and comprising a low-density (underdense) region wherein the plasma frequency is less than the laser radiation frequency and a higher-density (overdense) region wherein the plasma frequency is greater than the laser radiation frequency and,  about 1 to 30 nanoseconds after the precursor pulse strikes the target,  a higher-power main pulse focused onto the plasma for about 10.sup.-3 to 30 nanoseconds and having such power density and total energy that the radiant energy is absorbed in the underdense region and conducted into the overdense region to heat it and thus to produce X-rays therefrom with the plasma remaining substantially below normal solid density and thus facilitating the substantial emission of X-rays in the form of spectral lines arising from nonequilibrium ionization states. PAL The X-rays may be produced essentially as from a point source (i.e.,  they are spatially coherent) and thus are suitable for many applications that would otherwise require an X-ray laser. In some embodiments phase coherence is achieved,  thus providing a true X-ray laser. PAL In a similar method,  providing a controlled nuclear fusion reaction,  the target comprises alternate layers of high-Z and lower-Z material.

The chamber is subsequently filled with helium at atmospheric pressure and the plug 2 located on the casing 1 and welded thereto. The rod is then introduced into a pressurizing chamber which is purged before admitting helium at a pressure of 40 kg/cm.2 The helium at this pressure fractures the metallic membrane and thus opens the channel in the plug allowing helium under pressure to enter the rod. The channel is then closed by localized fusion of the surrounding metal by means of the TIG welding method. Alternative fusion methods include plasma welding,  resistance welding and laser welding.

Ignition of the charge is effected by the circuit 18 and the radiation energy is reflected by the lining 14 on to the target 20. A wall 21,  transparent to radiations may be inserted between 16 and 20,  thereby further reducing the contamination of 20 by 16. The explosive may be triggered by a laser beam and a spark gap may be employed to supply the radiation in place of the explosion. The wall 21 may be replaced by a solid ellipsoid which provides screening but does not restrict the pressure distribution.
